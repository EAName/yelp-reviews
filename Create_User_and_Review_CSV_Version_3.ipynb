I had a psycho literally scream at me at the restaurant. I made an announcement as to the rudeness. The supervisor intervened and took me outside and told me not to return and made up a lie about owing the restaurant 78 dollars. He hoarded the restaurant. It is a racist pit hole. As you walk in the black hostess is in the corner and they are all at the bar having a good time. He took the psycho's side in a minute like if I did anything wrong...it is the usual theme despite everything else being allowed in this country. \\n\\nSad to say another racist pit hole....full of shit and rudeness.  \n",

              "258440   I took two guests there for dinner. I ordered the appetizer sampler, which was supposed to be andouille sausage, Cajun shrimp, pimento cheese, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes,and homemade almond crackers. They brought it to the table, and left it without saying a word. It did not have either the cheese or the fried green tomatoes. \\n\\nWhen I let them know they forgot the cheese and tomatoes, they checked with the kitchen, came back to our table and said that the reason it did not come with the cheese and tomatoes was that the ran out. Period. I asked how you could advertise that it came with these things (for a $19 appetizer,) take our order without mentioning that you don't actually have the things I ordered, or at the very least once the kitchen realizes that they do not have the food  come back to our table and ask if we wanted to order something else, or would like to substitute something for the missing items?\\n\\nThe manager then came over and added more shrimp and sausage to make up for the missing items  (the \"homemade almond crackers\" had already been substituted with cut up pieces of plain toast, which they made no mention of.) \\n\\nI then asked the waiter about their \"Hot Chicken,\" to make sure that I could get it grilled, as I cannot eat fried chicken, to which he said yes you can get it pan seared. Of course they brought me fried chicken! I sent it back, and refused their offer to bring me something else. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was nice and so were the people, but they tried to rip us off with the appetizer, and made the wrong food. After taking my guests out for dinner - I had to stop and get take out on the way home! Dishonest and incompetent service - never again!  \n",

I have not visited this place for two months, since the change. Sadly the prices have gone up and the quality and gone down.\\n  To add insult to injury they have a new blonde manager who barely knows Indian food, but is loud and uncouth in her interactions.\\nNothing against her, just that a Indian manager in a Indian restaurant sounds a decent expectation. \\n Hopefully the owner gets a better cook and an Indian manager is not a tall order !  \n",

The food was horrible and the dining area was a complete mess. The young lady that waited the area was doing the best she could but you could tell they were not managed properly. It was not a busy day or time and still the problems. Hope they fix the issues and this place comes back, we had enjoyed going there before.  \n",

Me myself, I'm a BBQ extraordinaire. I'm qualified to Critique this type of stuff.\\n#1. There is no wood or Hickory or Smoke taste WHATSOEVER. This food was clearly made on a electric Smoker. Real BBQ Smokers like myself, only use Wood.\\n#2. Brisket had no BBQ taste. Tasted more so like Prime rib due to the lack of \"BBQ-LUSTER\"\\n#3. I requested every sauce. I only got one small sauce. I'm getting the notion they only have 1 sauce.\\n#4.The membrane on the back of the ribs wasn't removed.\\n#5. Ribs didn't have any kind of BBQ taste. Oven cooked or Electric. I can also tell them were a day old an reWarmed due to the way the meat fell off\\n#6 the basic salt an pepper on the brisket is 1970s. Break off on to new flavors an explore. Inject your meat. Switch it up.\\n\\n\\nLast but not least. When I initially tried to order the \"3 meat combo\" they didn't give me the option to order brisket also. I was forced to buy the two meat combo which gives you the option. Which sucked because it wasn't enough food.\\n\\n\\nAlso. WORCESTERSHIRE BASED BBQ SAUCE IS TERRIBLE. Thai An Worcestershire doesn't mix. You need new sauce.\\n\\nI've attached a picture of my BBQ to prove why I said what I Said.\\n\\n\\nYou're ruining the culture.  \n",
              "874245      AVERAGE-AT-BEST SUBURB RESTAURANT WITH CITY PRICING.\\n\\nAfter the flea market venture we were craving something \"authentic\". Again, yelped my way through town and discovered this mysteriously highly rated restaurant a try. I must say it was pretty empty for a saturday, now I know why. I call places like this, One-Hit-Wonder, I hit it once and never go back. What caught my attention was the highly rated positive yelp reviews, how did THIS restaurant, get this rating?! Cannot emphasize how much I DESPISE restaurants that offer little incentives here, free appetizers there for the sake of \"reviews\". Majority of the nice pictures uploaded are from the \"elite\" yelpers, c'mon now.\\n\\nWe ordered the usual, salad, appetizers and finally the main entrees. Put it this way, the food looks prettier than it tastes. Salad was decent, but then again how can you mess up sliced avocado with romaine lettuce? Appetizers and main entrees were a HUGE disappointment. Not only because it didn't taste authentic but it was sadly uncreative and boring. The chips were stale and seem recycled. Throughout the entire meal I got full on yuca fries (not much cooking involved) and some lettuce. I should have suppressed my hunger and waited to get some Sophie's back at home. The bill finally came, drum roll please~ I was shocked, the prices are an abomination. This place is a sad excuse for a peruvian/mexican restaurant. Perhaps having had something exquisitely authentic at Maura's Kitchen ruined my taste buds for anything bland and poorly, poorly, poorly mediocre. Not a huge fan of the chain On The Border, but I honestly had a better meal there.\\n\\n#Goelsewhere #Ripoff #Missingcrispandjuicy #Tacobellanyone?  \n",

Staff is slow, inattentive, and not worth the price.  We couldn't even get out check to go somewhere else.  \n",

That line is very true for this place.\\nI was here for the lunch buffet today. Regrets,\\n regrets and more regrets..\\nTo say it was lousy was an understatement. I wouldn't send my dog any close to this place. This is the first Indian buffet that I have seen serve chicken noodle soup from the can on the hot table. Yeah..Chicken noodle soup from the can to the hot table. \\nThe tandoori chicken was hard, unedible, the rice was dry the samosas were cooking in that heat and were all dried up. There was barely any food on the hot table.\\nThe tragedy was when I asked the owner why the buffet was close to $13.00 for food that was inedible and totally unsatisfying... the man started giving excuses and put up the victim face and he was in fact serving the best food in town. \\nPlease do NOT go to this place, not worth your time or your money. There are better places for Indian food, 5-6 miles away. Please don't..  \n",

She's just retarded! I felt so upset and angry when she said that. Having a special need child and hearing an employee say that word I felt offended and upset.. How unprofessional! I wish owner would keep their children at home and not messing up their business especially when they have NO MANNERS!  \n",

Never had food that has been so bad in the continental US before. The dessert was made at least 4 days before, smelled of bad coconut/milk. It reeked a foul odor\\n\\nI had the misfortune to call this guy who (apparently) is the owner. Couldn't call sooner, the place was closed for the guys sons wedding for a full week. \\nThe owner had the gonads to say that I'm lying and that the food he sells is \"always fresh\". With the internet, in this age; all foodies deserve better.\\n*PLEASE do not go to this place*..\\nthere are many better places to eat really great Indian food in this city.  \n",

It sure was not made fresh, worse you could smell the rancid oil, that was apparently used a few times over. \\nI was here 3 weeks ago for the Saturday buffet with 3 friends; all agreed that food was sub-par.

My wife and I went here and was told by the hosting staff the kitchen was over capacity and it would be an hour and 1/2 wait.   The place had many empty tables.   Not only did we walk out but three other couple's behind us as well that did the same.   I wanted to give this place a fair shot but its clear from the moment you walk in that its not the same place its reviews on here once were.  \n",

When the waiter placed the food on the table it looked scrumptious..boy can looks be deceiving! The batter was fried, hard and dark, nothing like the golden fried chicken advertised in the magazines, I'm starting to assume that chicken on television was bought elsewhere.\\n\\nNot to mention the fact that it was overly salted/seasoned and greasy, you'll catch a triple bypass on the second bite! \\nThe cornbread was dry --the red beans could've used half of the seasoning used for the chicken-my dinner roll was Ice cold like an eggo waffle Miss Willie Mae should've paid me $65 just to eat this over-priced slop. Don't waste your money! Highly Overrated!!\\nThe chicken reminds me of churches.\\nExcept churches is better.\\nMe and my girlfriend will never patronize again.  \n",

Forget about unlimited soup salad or bread sticks. Half our table didn't get their soup. Zero chance of finding the server for refills. Sides missing from one entree. When w left, half the tables were empty and set, but they were making people wait half an hour or more. Never again.  \n",

First thing I noticed was they remodeled and downsized the restaurant. The atmosphere is gone. It doesn't even look like a Chinese restaurant. I ordered Chow Mein as I've had many times in the past. What I received was very different from what I remembered. The noodles tasted old and there was barely any meat in the dish. The meat was tough and of poor quality. They must have new ownership and a new cook. Not friendly and inviting as it once was. The food was awful. I will not return.  \n",

Has the best flavors an chicken cooked perfectly.....Slowly but surely the quality of the food went down....I ordered my normal 10 piece with lemon pepper and fiya sauce. I get a phone call. No sauce, no problem. Just give me honey heat an please seperate my chicken so the flavors don't mix. I get home\\n\\nChicken is completely mixed. I ordered the garlic Rosemary Parmesan fries....the way my fries was prepared was beyond disrespectful. Like i said from day 1, I supported this spot, but there employees are ruining it. Specifically the young lady with the shaved hair cut that wears a weave all the time. Everytime I come she's always playing. She always screws my order up. The old cook use to cook the plates properly, but what I received today was very disappointing. I work overnight, so my night is completely screwed because I drove from Bullard all the way downtown just to get back to Bullard an realize that my food was jus tossed in the box.....I called to complain and the little girl had the nerve to argue back and forth with me as if I got time to make up lies about a chicken plate??? I'll never go again an it's no need to contact me cuz I ain't deleting this. Black people want us to support black biz but soon as black businesses realize they got a good thing, the quality goes out the window. Very disappointed.  \n",

My suggestion- try going to Shagun palace across the street, much better and cheaper food.  \n",

However, he has been in the business long enough, upgrading from a low class Italian eatery to this location on Sunrise Drive so you'd figure he must have a handle on how to present Italian food. NOT. I've been to this restaurant many times and also ordered takeout, meals and pizza. The food is not true Italian and at the best, it is OK in a pinch. When dining in, you never get the same level of service on a repeat visit. Always a different server and always slow and non-attentive. In 2016, I did see a cockroach same as another reviewer here. I have not dined in since and do not recommend because of that experience. The last few years, since their renovation, the dining area has been dirty and retains an unpleasant smell. Once in a while I order a pizza and pick it up. The pizza has always been good, although expensive as compared to others in the area. Hilariously, right along Sunrise Drive in that area, you have Trattorina Pina Italian, Fiamme Pizza, Dominos Pizza, Risky Business (Good Italian) and Gavi Pizza. Even more hilarious is that Pizza Hut opened right next to Bazil's. I wonder what prompted that????\\n\\nI do not recommend Bazil's due to uncleanliness and cockroaches.  \n",

First off, it's not that cheap. I don't mind paying money for something good but this place was a total letdown based on all the good reviews on Yelp regarding this chain. Unless the chicken is training for the olympics, this was one super rubbery, hard piece of meat I had to wash down with some mediocre horchata. Maduros were decent but I didn't go there cause I was craving sweet plantains. I had better fried chicken bought from Shoprite! \\n\\nNote to self: I guess I have to go back to eating Popeyes.  \n",

Gave this business three opportunities, and DiNapoli's has failed (as in gotten the order completely wrong) every chance.  Today's order included two pies:  both were terrible and personal sized, however they have the nerve to charge for a real, large sized, quality pizza.  Seriously, awful and WAY overpriced pizza.  Turkey & chs hoagie ordered: oil & mayo, no onion, w/ hot peppers.  Received: Dry, more onions than meat or chs, no hot peppers.  Owner is rude, young, inexperienced, and apparently overwhelmed (upon order on three occasions); workers nice enough, offered to deliver new food (not interested), however, owner stated upon order that no delivery available (although advertised) because delivery guy called out sick.

Paid with credit card. They said be there in 15-20 minutes and pizza will be ready.  I arrived at Domino's Pizza in 15 minutes and parked right in front of the window. They looked directly at me. I waited additional 15 minutes. People came and went with their pizza. Delivery people left in their cars with pizza. Finally, after 35 minutes, I got out of my car, went to the door and waved to get attention for someone to come out. The door is locked and they do not offer dine-in service or counter service due to Covid-19. When the manager Josh came to the door, I told him that I had been waiting for a pizza ordered and paid for over 30 minutes ago. Where is it? He went back inside looked around, then came out and told me he had no record of the order. Then, he said \"I see we forgot to make it.\" and \"They are just now stretching the dough, ...it will be an additional 20 minutes.\" This was outrageous. I asked for a refund, which I cheerfully received. What a waste of time. I will never go to Domino's again and I will tell everyone I know to stay away from this Domino's location.  \n",

Lousy experience.\\nPlease drive about 20 minutes north for some amazing Indian food. This place is bare bones with regard to variety, the taste is at best mediocre. At best this is a place for a \"non Indian\" crowd who don't know what to accept. \"Mirchi\" in Brunswick or even many more choices in Edison. \\nWhy would anyone not want to drive 20 minutes more pay 4 dollars more for food that tastes 10 times better and the buffet spread is 4 times more varied. \\nIndian food is much better than the stuff they serve here ! Don't let this place be your \"best experience\" of it..\\n\\n(I am not related to or own any restaurant, hard to not give a unbiased review when talking of food)  \n",

Go to McDonald's and have fries; but please don't go to this place. \\n\\nLousy food and even worse, lousy attitudes..\\n\\nI was at lunch at this place at 11 for the buffet when  it opened, waited till 1130 to start. They said they were open but they barely had any foot outside on the buffet. The food when it came, was awful. The tandoori chicken was okay.  The meal was not worth $13.00. They finally brought the bread (naan) to my table, when I was ready to pay. \\n\\nIf this wasn't enough, the icing to the cake is the attitude of the Bangladeshi waiter. There was a white couple sitting behind me; the waiter was very kind and courteous to. A second later he would come over and (maybe bcos I am Indian) act all high and haughty. Reach his arm across my face and fill the water in the glass without saying a word. Very immature and rude.  \n",

Do not go there. Not worth it at all. \\n\\nI paid for a Onam meal for 5 people - that includes about 21 side dishes; came home to find only 13, a few were doubles. Even after I drove back 30 min to get the remaining stuff, they only gave me 4 of the missing dishes. They said they were out of 2. And the portions were pathetic (picture included). \\nAll this when I reserved this 3 days in advance. \\n\\nHorrible food and customer service, do not go there.

Their ATM charges $1.75 + my banks fees for a foreign ATM. While I do not know why they choose to not take credit cards, many times when a business does this it is so they can not report income, and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. If this is the case, then not only did I get hit for a $1.75 (of which Pizza Box likely gets a portion), my bank fees, but I also end up having to pay more than my fair share of taxes as well! I wish I could say that the Pizza was good, but the Sicilian pizza I got there was not. A first and last time customer,  \n",

Instead of arriving at 10:45 and ordering a bunch of food 15min before they close like an asshole. I like to use the app so you know I can plan the fuck ahead. Friday night and now I have no quality food to eat because your app wants to be trash as fuck at certain locations. Don't open the store. If all your shit isn't right. And y'all been open for some months now and THERE IS NO MOBILE APP ORDERING AT THIS LOCATION. And my very first order from this location was wrong 2 weeks ago. Looks like ima have to go an extra 10min down the road to the Marlton location. Cherryhill location ass  \n",

I go to this place, all the way from New Orleans East, get the food, head home. Open the plate, no rice...half portion of steak which wasn't properly cooked. Ice cold veggies an 3 lobsters bites an 6 shrimp. I can't say what I want to say but this is pretty f***** Up. I spent 40 bucks. Couldn't even get a decent plate. I called an complained. Instead of them refunding my money, they told me when I come back I can get DOUBLE FRIED RICE \\nI'm not driving 30+ miles for rice. \\nI'll never go again an I dnt recommend anybody else going. One thing I hate is when folks can't honor when they screwed up. \\nEver since this pandemic started companies have been BEGGING people to spend money with them...for this??  \n",

Totally our fault. BUT, instead of calling all of our contact numbers or sending us a letter, SSFCU reports this to the credit bureaus and dings my wife's and my credit by 100 points. When called about this, they said \"not our fault\".  I will be ending my relationship as soon as I can, and I will go with a credit union that care enough to call/mail about things like this before killing my credit. A little human touch vs. automated calling would have solved this.  All for $1.83/month...nice customer service!  "

I'm getting the notion they only have 1 sauce.\\n#4.The membrane on the back of the ribs wasn't removed.\\n#5. Ribs didn't have any kind of BBQ taste. Oven cooked or Electric. I can also tell them were a day old an reWarmed due to the way the meat fell off\\n#6 the basic salt an pepper on the brisket is 1970s. Break off on to new flavors an explore. Inject your meat. Switch it up.\\n\\n\\nLast but not least. When I initially tried to order the \"3 meat combo\" they didn't give me the option to order brisket also. I was forced to buy the two meat combo which gives you the option. Which sucked because it wasn't enough food.\\n\\n\\nAlso. WORCESTERSHIRE BASED BBQ SAUCE IS TERRIBLE.

Again, yelped my way through town and discovered this mysteriously highly rated restaurant a try. I must say it was pretty empty for a saturday, now I know why. I call places like this, One-Hit-Wonder, I hit it once and never go back. What caught my attention was the highly rated positive yelp reviews, how did THIS restaurant, get this rating?! Cannot emphasize how much I DESPISE restaurants that offer little incentives here, free appetizers there for the sake of \"reviews\". Majority of the nice pictures uploaded are from the \"elite\" yelpers, c'mon now.\\n\\nWe ordered the usual, salad, appetizers and finally the main entrees. Put it this way, the food looks prettier than it tastes. Salad was decent, but then again how can you mess up sliced avocado with romaine lettuce? Appetizers and main entrees were a HUGE disappointment. Not only because it didn't taste authentic but it was sadly uncreative and boring. The chips were stale and seem recycled. Throughout the entire meal I got full on yuca fries (not much cooking involved) and some lettuce. I should have suppressed my hunger and waited to get some Sophie's back at home. The bill finally came, drum roll please~ I was shocked, the prices are an abomination. This place is a sad excuse for a peruvian/mexican restaurant. Perhaps having had something exquisitely authentic at Maura's Kitchen ruined my taste buds for anything bland and poorly, poorly, poorly mediocre. Not a huge fan of the chain On The Border, but I honestly had a better meal there.\\n\\n#Goelsewhere #Ripoff #Missingcrispandjuicy #Tacobellanyone?</td>\n",

When dining in, you never get the same level of service on a repeat visit. Always a different server and always slow and non-attentive. In 2016, I did see a cockroach same as another reviewer here. I have not dined in since and do not recommend because of that experience. The last few years, since their renovation, the dining area has been dirty and retains an unpleasant smell. Once in a while I order a pizza and pick it up. The pizza has always been good, although expensive as compared to others in the area. Hilariously, right along Sunrise Drive in that area, you have Trattorina Pina Italian, Fiamme Pizza, Dominos Pizza, Risky Business (Good Italian) and Gavi Pizza. Even more hilarious is that Pizza Hut opened right next to Bazil's. I wonder what prompted that????\\n\\nI do not recommend Bazil's due to uncleanliness and cockroaches.</td>\n",
