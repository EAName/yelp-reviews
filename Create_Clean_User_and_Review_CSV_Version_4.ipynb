I had a psycho literally scream at me at the restaurant. I made an announcement as to the rudeness. The supervisor intervened and took me outside and told me not to return and made up a lie about owing the restaurant 78 dollars. He hoarded the restaurant. It is a racist pit hole. As you walk in the black hostess is in the corner and they are all at the bar having a good time. He took the psycho's side in a minute like if I did anything wrong...it is the usual theme despite everything else being allowed in this country. \\n\\nSad to say another racist pit hole....full of shit and rudeness.  \n",

              "256859   I took two guests there for dinner. I ordered the appetizer sampler, which was supposed to be andouille sausage, Cajun shrimp, pimento cheese, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes,and homemade almond crackers. They brought it to the table, and left it without saying a word. It did not have either the cheese or the fried green tomatoes. \\n\\nWhen I let them know they forgot the cheese and tomatoes, they checked with the kitchen, came back to our table and said that the reason it did not come with the cheese and tomatoes was that the ran out. Period. I asked how you could advertise that it came with these things (for a $19 appetizer,) take our order without mentioning that you don't actually have the things I ordered, or at the very least once the kitchen realizes that they do not have the food  come back to our table and ask if we wanted to order something else, or would like to substitute something for the missing items?\\n\\nThe manager then came over and added more shrimp and sausage to make up for the missing items  (the \"homemade almond crackers\" had already been substituted with cut up pieces of plain toast, which they made no mention of.) \\n\\nI then asked the waiter about their \"Hot Chicken,\" to make sure that I could get it grilled, as I cannot eat fried chicken, to which he said yes you can get it pan seared. Of course they brought me fried chicken! I sent it back, and refused their offer to bring me something else. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was nice and so were the people, but they tried to rip us off with the appetizer, and made the wrong food. After taking my guests out for dinner - I had to stop and get take out on the way home! Dishonest and incompetent service - never again!  \n",

I have not visited this place for two months, since the change. Sadly the prices have gone up and the quality and gone down.\\n  To add insult to injury they have a new blonde manager who barely knows Indian food, but is loud and uncouth in her interactions.\\nNothing against her, just that a Indian manager in a Indian restaurant sounds a decent expectation. \\n Hopefully the owner gets a better cook and an Indian manager is not a tall order !  \n",

Me myself, I'm a BBQ extraordinaire. I'm qualified to Critique this type of stuff.\\n#1. There is no wood or Hickory or Smoke taste WHATSOEVER. This food was clearly made on a electric Smoker. Real BBQ Smokers like myself, only use Wood.\\n#2. Brisket had no BBQ taste. Tasted more so like Prime rib due to the lack of \"BBQ-LUSTER\"\\n#3. I requested every sauce. I only got one small sauce. I'm getting the notion they only have 1 sauce.\\n#4.The membrane on the back of the ribs wasn't removed.\\n#5. Ribs didn't have any kind of BBQ taste. Oven cooked or Electric. I can also tell them were a day old an reWarmed due to the way the meat fell off\\n#6 the basic salt an pepper on the brisket is 1970s. Break off on to new flavors an explore. Inject your meat. Switch it up.\\n\\n\\nLast but not least. When I initially tried to order the \"3 meat combo\" they didn't give me the option to order brisket also. I was forced to buy the two meat combo which gives you the option. Which sucked because it wasn't enough food.\\n\\n\\nAlso. WORCESTERSHIRE BASED BBQ SAUCE IS TERRIBLE. Thai An Worcestershire doesn't mix. You need new sauce.\\n\\nI've attached a picture of my BBQ to prove why I said what I Said.\\n\\n\\nYou're ruining the culture.  \n",
              "857187      AVERAGE-AT-BEST SUBURB RESTAURANT WITH CITY PRICING.\\n\\nAfter the flea market venture we were craving something \"authentic\". Again, yelped my way through town and discovered this mysteriously highly rated restaurant a try. I must say it was pretty empty for a saturday, now I know why. I call places like this, One-Hit-Wonder, I hit it once and never go back. What caught my attention was the highly rated positive yelp reviews, how did THIS restaurant, get this rating?! Cannot emphasize how much I DESPISE restaurants that offer little incentives here, free appetizers there for the sake of \"reviews\". Majority of the nice pictures uploaded are from the \"elite\" yelpers, c'mon now.\\n\\nWe ordered the usual, salad, appetizers and finally the main entrees. Put it this way, the food looks prettier than it tastes. Salad was decent, but then again how can you mess up sliced avocado with romaine lettuce? Appetizers and main entrees were a HUGE disappointment. Not only because it didn't taste authentic but it was sadly uncreative and boring. The chips were stale and seem recycled. Throughout the entire meal I got full on yuca fries (not much cooking involved) and some lettuce. I should have suppressed my hunger and waited to get some Sophie's back at home. The bill finally came, drum roll please~ I was shocked, the prices are an abomination. This place is a sad excuse for a peruvian/mexican restaurant. Perhaps having had something exquisitely authentic at Maura's Kitchen ruined my taste buds for anything bland and poorly, poorly, poorly mediocre. Not a huge fan of the chain On The Border, but I honestly had a better meal there.\\n\\n#Goelsewhere #Ripoff #Missingcrispandjuicy #Tacobellanyone?  \n",

Staff is slow, inattentive, and not worth the price.  We couldn't even get out check to go somewhere else.  \n",

That line is very true for this place.\\nI was here for the lunch buffet today. Regrets,\\n regrets and more regrets..\\nTo say it was lousy was an understatement. I wouldn't send my dog any close to this place. This is the first Indian buffet that I have seen serve chicken noodle soup from the can on the hot table. Yeah..Chicken noodle soup from the can to the hot table. \\nThe tandoori chicken was hard, unedible, the rice was dry the samosas were cooking in that heat and were all dried up. There was barely any food on the hot table.\\nThe tragedy was when I asked the owner why the buffet was close to $13.00 for food that was inedible and totally unsatisfying... the man started giving excuses and put up the victim face and he was in fact serving the best food in town. \\nPlease do NOT go to this place, not worth your time or your money. There are better places for Indian food, 5-6 miles away. Please don't..  \n",

She's just retarded! I felt so upset and angry when she said that. Having a special need child and hearing an employee say that word I felt offended and upset.. How unprofessional! I wish owner would keep their children at home and not messing up their business especially when they have NO MANNERS!  \n",

Never had food that has been so bad in the continental US before. The dessert was made at least 4 days before, smelled of bad coconut/milk. It reeked a foul odor\\n\\nI had the misfortune to call this guy who (apparently) is the owner. Couldn't call sooner, the place was closed for the guys sons wedding for a full week. \\nThe owner had the gonads to say that I'm lying and that the food he sells is \"always fresh\". With the internet, in this age; all foodies deserve better.\\n*PLEASE do not go to this place*..\\nthere are many better places to eat really great Indian food in this city.  \n",

It sure was not made fresh, worse you could smell the rancid oil, that was apparently used a few times over. \\nI was here 3 weeks ago for the Saturday buffet with 3 friends; all agreed that food was sub-par.

My wife and I went here and was told by the hosting staff the kitchen was over capacity and it would be an hour and 1/2 wait.   The place had many empty tables.   Not only did we walk out but three other couple's behind us as well that did the same.   I wanted to give this place a fair shot but its clear from the moment you walk in that its not the same place its reviews on here once were.  \n",

When the waiter placed the food on the table it looked scrumptious..boy can looks be deceiving! The batter was fried, hard and dark, nothing like the golden fried chicken advertised in the magazines, I'm starting to assume that chicken on television was bought elsewhere.\\n\\nNot to mention the fact that it was overly salted/seasoned and greasy, you'll catch a triple bypass on the second bite! \\nThe cornbread was dry --the red beans could've used half of the seasoning used for the chicken-my dinner roll was Ice cold like an eggo waffle Miss Willie Mae should've paid me $65 just to eat this over-priced slop. Don't waste your money! Highly Overrated!!\\nThe chicken reminds me of churches.\\nExcept churches is better.\\nMe and my girlfriend will never patronize again.  \n",

Forget about unlimited soup salad or bread sticks. Half our table didn't get their soup. Zero chance of finding the server for refills. Sides missing from one entree. When w left, half the tables were empty and set, but they were making people wait half an hour or more. Never again.  \n",

First thing I noticed was they remodeled and downsized the restaurant. The atmosphere is gone. It doesn't even look like a Chinese restaurant. I ordered Chow Mein as I've had many times in the past. What I received was very different from what I remembered. The noodles tasted old and there was barely any meat in the dish. The meat was tough and of poor quality. They must have new ownership and a new cook. Not friendly and inviting as it once was. The food was awful. I will not return.  \n",

Has the best flavors an chicken cooked perfectly.....Slowly but surely the quality of the food went down....I ordered my normal 10 piece with lemon pepper and fiya sauce. I get a phone call. No sauce, no problem. Just give me honey heat an please seperate my chicken so the flavors don't mix. I get home\\n\\nChicken is completely mixed. I ordered the garlic Rosemary Parmesan fries....the way my fries was prepared was beyond disrespectful. Like i said from day 1, I supported this spot, but there employees are ruining it. Specifically the young lady with the shaved hair cut that wears a weave all the time. Everytime I come she's always playing. She always screws my order up. The old cook use to cook the plates properly, but what I received today was very disappointing. I work overnight, so my night is completely screwed because I drove from Bullard all the way downtown just to get back to Bullard an realize that my food was jus tossed in the box.....I called to complain and the little girl had the nerve to argue back and forth with me as if I got time to make up lies about a chicken plate??? I'll never go again an it's no need to contact me cuz I ain't deleting this. Black people want us to support black biz but soon as black businesses realize they got a good thing, the quality goes out the window. Very disappointed.  \n",

My suggestion- try going to Shagun palace across the street, much better and cheaper food.  \n",

However, he has been in the business long enough, upgrading from a low class Italian eatery to this location on Sunrise Drive so you'd figure he must have a handle on how to present Italian food. NOT. I've been to this restaurant many times and also ordered takeout, meals and pizza. The food is not true Italian and at the best, it is OK in a pinch. When dining in, you never get the same level of service on a repeat visit. Always a different server and always slow and non-attentive. In 2016, I did see a cockroach same as another reviewer here. I have not dined in since and do not recommend because of that experience. The last few years, since their renovation, the dining area has been dirty and retains an unpleasant smell. Once in a while I order a pizza and pick it up. The pizza has always been good, although expensive as compared to others in the area. Hilariously, right along Sunrise Drive in that area, you have Trattorina Pina Italian, Fiamme Pizza, Dominos Pizza, Risky Business (Good Italian) and Gavi Pizza. Even more hilarious is that Pizza Hut opened right next to Bazil's. I wonder what prompted that????\\n\\nI do not recommend Bazil's due to uncleanliness and cockroaches.  \n",

First off, it's not that cheap. I don't mind paying money for something good but this place was a total letdown based on all the good reviews on Yelp regarding this chain. Unless the chicken is training for the olympics, this was one super rubbery, hard piece of meat I had to wash down with some mediocre horchata. Maduros were decent but I didn't go there cause I was craving sweet plantains. I had better fried chicken bought from Shoprite! \\n\\nNote to self: I guess I have to go back to eating Popeyes.  \n",

Gave this business three opportunities, and DiNapoli's has failed (as in gotten the order completely wrong) every chance.  Today's order included two pies:  both were terrible and personal sized, however they have the nerve to charge for a real, large sized, quality pizza.  Seriously, awful and WAY overpriced pizza.  Turkey & chs hoagie ordered: oil & mayo, no onion, w/ hot peppers.  Received: Dry, more onions than meat or chs, no hot peppers.  Owner is rude, young, inexperienced, and apparently overwhelmed (upon order on three occasions); workers nice enough, offered to deliver new food (not interested), however, owner stated upon order that no delivery available (although advertised) because delivery guy called out sick.

Paid with credit card. They said be there in 15-20 minutes and pizza will be ready.  I arrived at Domino's Pizza in 15 minutes and parked right in front of the window. They looked directly at me. I waited additional 15 minutes. People came and went with their pizza. Delivery people left in their cars with pizza. Finally, after 35 minutes, I got out of my car, went to the door and waved to get attention for someone to come out. The door is locked and they do not offer dine-in service or counter service due to Covid-19. When the manager Josh came to the door, I told him that I had been waiting for a pizza ordered and paid for over 30 minutes ago. Where is it? He went back inside looked around, then came out and told me he had no record of the order. Then, he said \"I see we forgot to make it.\" and \"They are just now stretching the dough, ...it will be an additional 20 minutes.\" This was outrageous. I asked for a refund, which I cheerfully received. What a waste of time. I will never go to Domino's again and I will tell everyone I know to stay away from this Domino's location.  \n",

Lousy experience.\\nPlease drive about 20 minutes north for some amazing Indian food. This place is bare bones with regard to variety, the taste is at best mediocre. At best this is a place for a \"non Indian\" crowd who don't know what to accept. \"Mirchi\" in Brunswick or even many more choices in Edison. \\nWhy would anyone not want to drive 20 minutes more pay 4 dollars more for food that tastes 10 times better and the buffet spread is 4 times more varied. \\nIndian food is much better than the stuff they serve here ! Don't let this place be your \"best experience\" of it..\\n\\n(I am not related to or own any restaurant, hard to not give a unbiased review when talking of food)  \n",

Go to McDonald's and have fries; but please don't go to this place. \\n\\nLousy food and even worse, lousy attitudes..\\n\\nI was at lunch at this place at 11 for the buffet when  it opened, waited till 1130 to start. They said they were open but they barely had any foot outside on the buffet. The food when it came, was awful. The tandoori chicken was okay.  The meal was not worth $13.00. They finally brought the bread (naan) to my table, when I was ready to pay. \\n\\nIf this wasn't enough, the icing to the cake is the attitude of the Bangladeshi waiter. There was a white couple sitting behind me; the waiter was very kind and courteous to. A second later he would come over and (maybe bcos I am Indian) act all high and haughty. Reach his arm across my face and fill the water in the glass without saying a word. Very immature and rude.  \n",

Do not go there. Not worth it at all. \\n\\nI paid for a Onam meal for 5 people - that includes about 21 side dishes; came home to find only 13, a few were doubles. Even after I drove back 30 min to get the remaining stuff, they only gave me 4 of the missing dishes. They said they were out of 2. And the portions were pathetic (picture included). \\nAll this when I reserved this 3 days in advance. \\n\\nHorrible food and customer service, do not go there.

Their ATM charges $1.75 + my banks fees for a foreign ATM. While I do not know why they choose to not take credit cards, many times when a business does this it is so they can not report income, and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. If this is the case, then not only did I get hit for a $1.75 (of which Pizza Box likely gets a portion), my bank fees, but I also end up having to pay more than my fair share of taxes as well! I wish I could say that the Pizza was good, but the Sicilian pizza I got there was not. A first and last time customer,  \n",

Instead of arriving at 10:45 and ordering a bunch of food 15min before they close like an asshole. I like to use the app so you know I can plan the fuck ahead. Friday night and now I have no quality food to eat because your app wants to be trash as fuck at certain locations. Don't open the store. If all your shit isn't right. And y'all been open for some months now and THERE IS NO MOBILE APP ORDERING AT THIS LOCATION. And my very first order from this location was wrong 2 weeks ago. Looks like ima have to go an extra 10min down the road to the Marlton location. Cherryhill location ass  \n",

Tasted more so like Prime rib due to the lack of \"BBQ-LUSTER\"\\n#3. I requested every sauce. I only got one small sauce. I'm getting the notion they only have 1 sauce.\\n#4.The membrane on the back of the ribs wasn't removed.\\n#5. Ribs didn't have any kind of BBQ taste. Oven cooked or Electric. I can also tell them were a day old an reWarmed due to the way the meat fell off\\n#6 the basic salt an pepper on the brisket is 1970s. Break off on to new flavors an explore. Inject your meat. Switch it up.\\n\\n\\nLast but not least. When I initially tried to order the \"3 meat combo\" they didn't give me the option to order brisket also. I was forced to buy the two meat combo which gives you the option. Which sucked because it wasn't enough food.\\n\\n\\nAlso. WORCESTERSHIRE BASED BBQ SAUCE IS TERRIBLE.

Again, yelped my way through town and discovered this mysteriously highly rated restaurant a try. I must say it was pretty empty for a saturday, now I know why. I call places like this, One-Hit-Wonder, I hit it once and never go back. What caught my attention was the highly rated positive yelp reviews, how did THIS restaurant, get this rating?! Cannot emphasize how much I DESPISE restaurants that offer little incentives here, free appetizers there for the sake of \"reviews\". Majority of the nice pictures uploaded are from the \"elite\" yelpers, c'mon now.\\n\\nWe ordered the usual, salad, appetizers and finally the main entrees. Put it this way, the food looks prettier than it tastes. Salad was decent, but then again how can you mess up sliced avocado with romaine lettuce? Appetizers and main entrees were a HUGE disappointment. Not only because it didn't taste authentic but it was sadly uncreative and boring. The chips were stale and seem recycled. Throughout the entire meal I got full on yuca fries (not much cooking involved) and some lettuce. I should have suppressed my hunger and waited to get some Sophie's back at home. The bill finally came, drum roll please~ I was shocked, the prices are an abomination. This place is a sad excuse for a peruvian/mexican restaurant. Perhaps having had something exquisitely authentic at Maura's Kitchen ruined my taste buds for anything bland and poorly, poorly, poorly mediocre. Not a huge fan of the chain On The Border, but I honestly had a better meal there.\\n\\n#Goelsewhere #Ripoff #Missingcrispandjuicy #Tacobellanyone?</td>\n",

NOT. I've been to this restaurant many times and also ordered takeout, meals and pizza. The food is not true Italian and at the best, it is OK in a pinch. When dining in, you never get the same level of service on a repeat visit. Always a different server and always slow and non-attentive. In 2016, I did see a cockroach same as another reviewer here. I have not dined in since and do not recommend because of that experience. The last few years, since their renovation, the dining area has been dirty and retains an unpleasant smell. Once in a while I order a pizza and pick it up. The pizza has always been good, although expensive as compared to others in the area. Hilariously, right along Sunrise Drive in that area, you have Trattorina Pina Italian, Fiamme Pizza, Dominos Pizza, Risky Business (Good Italian) and Gavi Pizza. Even more hilarious is that Pizza Hut opened right next to Bazil's. I wonder what prompted that????\\n\\nI do not recommend Bazil's due to uncleanliness and cockroaches.</td>\n",

They said they were open but they barely had any foot outside on the buffet. The food when it came, was awful. The tandoori chicken was okay.  The meal was not worth $13.00. They finally brought the bread (naan) to my table, when I was ready to pay. \\n\\nIf this wasn't enough, the icing to the cake is the attitude of the Bangladeshi waiter. There was a white couple sitting behind me; the waiter was very kind and courteous to. A second later he would come over and (maybe bcos I am Indian) act all high and haughty.

I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. It's Louisiana's shrimp, eggs, andouille sausage and jalapeno cheese grits. I hella loved it. It was cooked like a sauce and all mixed together perfectly on top of a very very very bomb jalapeno cheese grits. The grits I would say was the highlight. This girl loves grits and with jalapeno even more amazing. I would definitely come back again.  \n",

If I was more of a writer I would write a novel about this place. Bottom line, the food here is amazing New Orleans food with so much flavor.  \n",

The interior is clean and classy in appearance, complete with beautiful white table cloth that makes me feel even fancier when I come here. The food is just as good and is and isn't your typical Italian. Most notable would be the scallops and polenta with lobster sauce, their blt salad (not photographed) and the basil pesto chicken fettuccine that I had on my most recent visit. I've also had their classic lasagna which is pretty good, and uses béchamel sauce in it. The staff is very kind and accommodating. I showed up 30 minutes before dinner hour, yet they were willing to let me order off the dinner menu. I ordered their watercress salad to start off my  meal. It was very light and refreshing from the slices of granny smith apple, and the blue cheese and pecans added more layers of flavor and texture. The basil pesto fettuccine pasta came next. This dish had a very buttery flavor to it and went well with the grilled chicken and mushrooms mixed in. As beautiful as the interior is, I enjoyed eating my meal outside which is just as classy and well polished in appearance. It was a perfect spot to people watch and enjoy the beautiful day. I would definitely have to try the brunch next time though.  \n",

Being that I lost my sense of taste and smell, my options were fairly limited, but I knew I had to eat something. I was feeling like something light along with something starchy, so I thought this was a good choice. I went with their chicken salad due to my coworker having gotten this a long time ago,   raving about their homemade dressing. So i went with that. I've also had their fried Yuca sticks with spicy cheese sauce. Both items were delicious despite my lack of taste, i could appreciate the texture that came through. I actually did taste the cheese sauce, though mildly, and i could appreciate the spiciness and the rich, creamy texture. The salad itself was quite a sight to behold as it was a rather large size, though not unbearably filling. There was ample chicken sitting on a bed of lettuce, and their thick cilantro dressing was on the bottom. It made for a really good quarantine meal, and I was glad I had the opportunity to try it.  \n",

Service was excellent. I spilled my drink, they were quick to clean it up and have a replacement in seconds. Then there was the food, OMG the food was fantastic!!! I love tapas style eating, my taste-buds have more to enjoy before my tummy gets full. Party in the mouth, celebrate all the wonderful flavors. Decor is clean, not over stimulating to really focus on the company and food. I have been to a dozen Tapas dining, all delicious...This is in my top 2 favorites.  \n",

Service was excellent. I spilled my drink, they were quick to clean it up and have a replacement in seconds. Then there was the food, OMG the food was fantastic!!! I love tapas style eating, my tastes buds have more to enjoy before my tummy gets full. Party in the mouth, celebrate all the wonderful flavors. Decor is clean, not over stimulating to really focus on the company and food. I have been to a dozen Tapas dining, all delicious...This in my top 2 favorites. \\n\\nPart 2: we went again last night for a smaller snack...again, staff is very friendly and hospitable as if it were their own home. The food couldn't be more delicious! Thanks for making our Nashville visit a memorable one.  \n",

Probably the most authentic Asian food you can find in Reno, although we didn't look very hard. The portions were good and the restaurant was surprisingly clean despite the rapid customer turnover.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in Reno and crave some Taiwanese delicacies, then head on over to 101. Hopefully you'll beat the Asian line on your way to enjoying a flavorful bowl of beef noodle soup.  \n",

What a sweet spot, right on magazine in Lower Garden District, location and service can't be beat! Their vegan egg rolls are soooooo good (made with yarrow and carrot, will delight a vegan and could fool a meat eater ). The spicy tofu with rice and steamed veggies and vegan tofu pho are both AMAZING. Generous serving sizes makes it great for family style or individual dining. It's usually bustling but even at its busiest they've always managed tables well with great service! Prices are good too!! Love Lilly's, I will be back again and again!  \n",

The beer was strong and the food was tasty.  We ordered the BLT pork belly sliders and the Spicy Tuna Poke.  The sliders were large (very thick slice of pork belly, nicely charred) and the poke was nice with the cabbage salad.  Our server, Aracely, was very kind and knowledgeable about the beers on tap (great memory).  Large open dining room with lots of tv screens for sports.  \n",

The first time I was solo, but the second time, I brought my boyfriend and a friend. For this meal, I ordered their caprese salad, which was mozzarella and parmesan cheese and grape tomatoes nestled in a bed of arugula. There was some pesto on the mozzarella, and the salad was complemented with two pieces of sourdough bread. I enjoyed spreading the mozzarella over the bread and made a mini sandwich with the rest of the arugula and tomatoes. For my main course, I had their cavatelli pasta with spinach, pesto, pine nuts, and chopped up butternut squash with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. I loved this dish, as the pesto (which I love) coated the cavatelli nicely and the pine nuts gave it a good crunch. Fair portion too. I actually had to take at least half of it home, and it was good for late evening. My boyfriend had a lobster roll that came with a side salad and told me his meal was wonderful. My coworker enjoyed her crabcakes with salmon immensely. We finished off the night with some drinks. I had their Tryst drink, which was strawberry with vodka, and my companion had Walk on the Pier and a Tryst. Boyfriend had Whiskey Sour. Now, I'm not much of a drinker, so it was a bit strong for my taste, but I enjoyed the strawberry flavor! Great place to go people watch in the middle of Beach Drive! If the weather is nice, I strongly recommend eating Al Fresco to enjoy being part of the scene!  \n",

Another DJs here so we will definitely be back.  \n",

I had no time to really look at everything, so after i did my thing for work, i came right back, not wanting to brave the drive back hungry, and determined to check them out. It was also a gloomy, rainy day, and i was a little irritated that i had to come out this way for work. Luckily, i was able to turn my negative into something positive by using that opportunity to discover a new place! The interior is beautiful, making you feel like you are in a luau with their Tiki statues and decor. With the soft lighting and the ambiance its easy to forget youre in Florida in the rain and not in Hawaii. I was the only customer there, and the owner was training new staff, so I got alot of attention. They gave me time to peruse the menu before making a selection. I did notice they had alot of good sounding cocktails and treats, but I wasnt planning on drinking or splurging, so i looked at the healthier options, which thankfully they had alot of. They had salad, but as usual, I wasnt in the mood for it so i got the Dos Tacos with Ahi Poke and a shot of coleslaw. It was a good choice, as it really hit the spot after a stressful day that felt wasted, but my mood quickly changed. The tacos were generously filled and had ample amounts of Ahi Poke that went great with the Asian slaw. On top of Ahi, there was alot of other stuff in the tacos like some feta, some crisp tasty veggies. The tacos came out bigger than i had expected, so i was fully satiated by the time i was done with the meal. The nice young lady who was my server was very attentive and checked on me frequently to make sure I didnt need anything else. I definitely need to come back at some point for their dessert, and have a few cocktails with my boyfriend. It made my rainy day better, but I would love to see the deck on a clear summer's eve.  \n",

Felt like a hole in the wall, hip pizza joint with great selections and pizza! Their crust is whole-wheat, thin crust and they put lots of goodies on it! They had a beer tap with an assortment of flavors and the people were hip and friendly. Go get a taste of hip and cool!  \n",

The restaurant is uber cool with its aquariums. Nothing more soothing that viewing tranquil fish doing their thing. All the team members were very polite and skillful in their roles to enhance our dining experience. Thank you!  \n",

For his birthday, I decided to give him a very special treat by coming here for their brunch AND dinner! The nice thing is that it gave me a chance to sample a variety of dishes that they serve here. I started off my day with their Grand Marnier French toast with a side of bacon while my boyfriend had their chicken and waffles and their special $2 mimosa. Our nice waitress let me substitute the potatoes with bacon since I already wanted bacon on the side, and honestly it was good tip because I got pretty full from the French toast alone. I actually really loved their French toast, which was thick and rich, but not heavy. I don't get it very often for one, so when I do, its a nice treat. Theirs was made with Grand Marnier, which actually did come through in the flavor and gave it a nice twist. I really loved the baked apples that came with it as a good finishing touch. My boyfriend of course demolished his meal and loved it. I did notice that it was a large portion. The overall price was not bad at all, and I could see us coming back just for their brunch. \\n     Okay, so seven hours later we were up for round two and had the same sweet waitress we saw at brunch (we even gave her an advance warning we were coming back, so she wasn't too surprised to see us again). Still full from Brunch, I zeroed in on their duck wings, something that I noticed seems to be one of their specialties. I had that with a side of their hard cider cole slaw. I don't drink very often, but this being a tavern, I made sure I at least tried one drink and went for their Blackberry Collins, which to me tasted like a Blackberry juice. It had fresh blackberries and a mint leaf for garnish which gave it a nice touch. I could not taste the alcohol (which is good for me because I don't drink) however, it did sneak up on me after I finished it. The duck wings here were amazing and make me forget any other kind of chicken wing I've ever had. They were large, meaty, and were well coated in a sweet glaze. I had this with their delicious homemade special sauce (ranch?). \\n     Overall, I really enjoyed coming here even though it was for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was wonderful and she was very attentive to our party of six (during dinner). Although I didn't try their actual dinner entrées, the quality shines in the food I got. I could see myself back for their brunch or wings and a drink on a late night.  \n",

The margs were super strong, I got the \"be fit\" kinda low calorie one and Anthony got the top shelf kind, both were strong and good. We got chips and salsa too and enjoyed our time there. Conveniently located on St Charles Ave in the uptown area, this is a large accommodating restaurant that is good for groups and/or dates. We also had a shot of tequila, it's a good thing we were walking distance!  \n",

Their \"Fresh. Tasty. Simple.\" tagline sums them up perfectly. Their turkey sandwiches are some of the best I've tasted. I think its the mix of their turkey breast with the feta cheese and spreads that really do it for me along with perfectly toasted bread. So far I've tried their Turkey Stack and their Gruben, which is a nice little twist on the Ruben, only theirs has marinated slaw and turkey breast. Their sides are all really good and a unique alternative to the normal potato chips, but I think my favorite is the pasta salad because of the rich feta and basil with sun dried tomato. It has a very rich and complex taste that's not heavy. In my opinion they also have some of the best falafel. I love how perfectly crisp on the inside and soft on the inside they are, no a mushy sloppy mess that I've had with others. The nice thing is that you can have their falafel vegan if you skip the tzatziki and feta and its every bit as tasty (yes, I've tried it both ways). I really like how they display the number of calories on the website as well as their menu in the store as it helps people make better decisions about what to eat, if you're trying to eat healthy. Otherwise, they have decadent sweet treats too if that's your thing (which I need to try).  \n",

We eat here all the time. I usually get the sausage plate which includes saurkraut and potato salad and only  costs $12.   I have tried everything on the menu and it is all great.  Check with the owner about their Xmas menu of duck which requires a 2 day reservation.  \n",

Everything is half off during February so we were really happy to snag the generous pricing. The burger and house made chips were irresistible and my bacon jalapeño Mac and cheese, awesome comfort food. So lucky my partner isn't a cheese fan! The portions were generous so I got leftovers.

Now you don't have to drive downtown.  I have had the Panang Curry, Pad Prick King, and Pad Thai noodles her and all have been good.  They have great lunch specials for around $10 and do take out.  Plus they have tons of parking.  \n",

In my opinion if a pizza place does sandwiches, give em a try! Why?? Its all in the bread, which is basically the same dough as their pizza (and I love and adore pizza!!).What makes Tampa Pizza so special in particular is everything else in the sandwich is high in quality so i keep forgetting theyre a pizza place. Each sandwich is assembled with love and care every time I order one. Their meats are tender and in just the right proportion, well seasoned and cooked. I love their grilled chicken and hand carved turkey. They also come with quality greens, and sauces. My favorite is the Turkey Bacon swiss sandwich which has a generous portion of that tender turkey I love so much, a pile of flavorful crispy bacon, and swiss cheese melted in their delicious organic bread that is the crown jewel of any sandwich. You can pair the sandwich with fries, but the sandwich itself is so filling i opt for the arugula salad. Its not much to rave about, i mean its salad, but its a good side to go with it if your watching your calories and you want help digesting your food so the meal's not so heavy. Admittedly i have yet to have their pizza, but rest assured I plan on it.  \n",

I always order this to gauge how good a new place is and this dish gets a 100 put of 100. The mixture of heat and flavor was phenomenal. Super generous portion and shrimp size. Also ordered the homemade horchata and also wow! \\n\\nI'm so glad this place is not too far from my office. Will definitely be back again, and again, and again  \n",

Wait was a little long, but it was lunch, so no biggie. \\n\\nTried the Ace (pepperoni) and rabbit (house) salad.  Both were delicious. Sodas are Jones as well, which taste great. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back again.  \n",

I had a salmon salad and my hubby had a salmon philly sandwich with seasoned broccoli!  With a side of gospel music and praising Jesus!  Soo good!  And they also gave us some hand cut potato chips that I couldn't resist! Drop by!  You won't be disappointed!  \n",

At first I thought it was going to be another run of the mill Latin chicken place with lots of rice and beans. Well, it has rice and beans if that's your thing, but if not, you're in luck. I took one look at the menu and was excited that they had a decent variety of offerings: salads, sandwiches, and premium sides like fresh sauteed veggies, pasta salad, and potato salad.  So far I'm more than pleased with this place. I've been here twice and the quality is actually pretty good. The first thing I had was a Havana Cobb salad that had a generous amount of chicken as well as bacon and avocado. I had this to go for dinner and it did the trick filling me up.  On my second visit, i got a two piece dark meat meal which consisted of pasta salad and fresh veggies. What pleased me most was that the veggies were crisp and sauteed, not something bland and boring, boiled to mush. I also loved how the chicken was juicy and fall off the bone tender. I did like the pasta salad, but I wasn't too thrilled that it had pineapple and was more on the sweet side and the portion was bigger than expected. It was still good, but I'll go with potato salad instead next time  \n",

I stop by for a roast pork every time I'm in Philly. Great bread with some crunch, succulent meat and great people. Try the cheese steak after the roast pork and then decide.  \n",

We've been there numerous times and the outcome is always terrific, except when our belly is to full of Root Beer floats ;)\\nThe last time we went, we had THE BEST SERVICE ever there.  Our server was fantastic and gave us the perfect amount of attention.  Food was delicious and dessert was better!!  \\nThank you Kaitlin & Red Robin!\\n\\n(04/13/16 -6:15PM -table 512)  \n",

Our server Robbie made my Dad's 60th birthday so special. The drinks are wonderful. The blackberry martini is worth a trip all on its own. The food is delicious. You name it is great - salmon, steak, sides, dessert. You must try the Baked Alaska. It is classic but so refined. The homemade banana ice cream that comes with is out of this world. I would make a trip to Philly just to go to Butcher and Singer again. I also loved the atmosphere- Art Deco and you feel like you have stepped back in time. Such a wonderful experience.  \n",

The entire ambiance and aesthetic is so beautiful. We made a reservation last minute to come eat here Saturday evening. We accidentally booked it for the 18th instead and they were so accommodating to change it for the 17th and seat us. The entire menu was so delicious it was so hard to choose what to eat! We started off with some cocktails: the optimist & side car. Both had distinct tastes to it, so I recommend reading what's in each drink before you decide. Then we had crab cakes, which were so delicious I'm still thinking about them! When then ordered the Cesar salad and for our main course we ordered the rack of lamb and porter house for two. Both were so delicious and filling we wanted to keep eating but were getting so full. For the sides, we ordered the stuffed hash browns, creamed spinach & grilled asparagus.\\n\\nI definitely recommend eating here, it is so pretty inside and everything is beyond delicious.  \n",

I get chicken and pineapple with medium curry and it's always piping hot and just perfectly spicy. Everything they serve is so fresh and cooked to perfection. I know this is crazy but they serve ice water in a real glass and the water always taste so crystal clear and clean! It's a busy place but service is on spot  \n",

By the time we finalized our plans, we were on Frenchmen Street, and called to ask about the wait just in case. When we arrived, we were seated immediately, which was a nice surprise on the weekend.  \\n\\nComing from the West Coast, we wanted to try something new and authentic made in the heart of this city, so we went with the Shrimp and Alligator Sausage Cheesecake and Deep Fried Roast Beef Po-Boy, respectively. When in town for the first time, trust the locals, especially if a place is recommended more than once. So thankful we came across a few kindhearted souls who suggested that we give this place a try.\\n\\nThe cheesecake was extremely delicious. We weren't disappointed at all as to how savory this slice was. I would definitely order this again and would highly recommend any first-timer to try it. My wife was ecstatic for the Po-Boy and she ended up mentioning that it was the best one she has ever had. I gave it a try, was also blown away, and said the same thing. The service was excellent and our server helped us with our choices since there were so many dishes to choose from and they all looked delicious! It was the best meal to end the evening of an adventurous day.  \n",

The staff was great. The food was very good. For the appetizers we had the wings and seafood spring-rolls (watch the hot sauce!) I had the Turkey burger which taste great. Save room for the Monkey bread dessert!!!!!  \n",

We are here traveling from out of town. Food is really important especially when you're traveling on a vacation your expectations are a little higher. \\n\\n  We weren't disappointed at the Fork. We \\nMade a reservation days before. A family member who lives here in town highly recommended this place so we took the suggestion and glad we did. The food was all on point. A few of us had a couple special request and all of that was met. The food all came out really good. My wife got a protein style burger, uncle got a steak, aunt got a Hawaiian chicken of some sort and my self a recommended brisket sandwich. Everyone was happy and the entire plate was cleared. \\n\\n Our servers were Ryan & Rochelle, they did a great job making sure we were taking care of. They knew the menu pretty well explaining things very thoroughly, and were very accommodating. They didn't miss a beat on filling up drinks, sauces, checking in on the meal and making sure the steak was cooked properly. \\n\\n We ended up getting dessert: Butter cake and an epic bread pudding (highly recommend) \\n\\n  If you're looking for good food in Boise I would highly recommend this place and also make reservations it seems to be a popular spot, you will not be let down. \\n\\n Very grateful we found this place. \\n\\nGood job Fork Chefs and good job Ryan & Rochelle \\nTeam R & R \\n\\n-The friendly people from California, don't worry we're only here to visit, keep\\nDoing what your doing. We had a great experience.  \n",

Vegan is one thing. A top tier bar with unbelievable cocktails and artistry is another, and Charlie's is 5 star.\\n\\nFriends who were never into \"vegan\" can't wait to go back here every single time in Philly.\\n\\nFirst time visiting and knocked it out of the park. Another case of a \"vegetarian\" eatery where every dish and the tastes are incredible. Started with the well known Wheat Grass Shot, followed by lemon Goin' Down Easy. The Charred Caesar was incredible and flavor galore (yes, a salad can be mind blowing, try it) and Bucatini with \"Meatballs\". No meat, all veggies, and every last bit tasted out of this world, with great service and recommendations at the bar on a Sunday night. Finished with Peach Bourbon Tart (wow) and Done and Dusted cold espresso drink that mimics caffeinated clean and cold chocolate in a wineglass. Had never been here before and will definitely return often.  \n",

We came here early Saturday for a good hangover cure and the place was already packed! We started off with some gyozas & fried chicken buns. They come out really hot so be careful when you're digging in! Then for our main dishes we ordered the spicy ramen & shoyu ramen. Both ramens definitely helped with our hangovers and cleared our sinuses. We ended our meal by ordering the mochis and ordered all the flavors, the strawberry mochi was my favorite for sure. This place is so good and everyone works really fast to get your meal ready and yummy! I also recommend getting their hot green tea, this also helped me a lot with my hangover and headache.  \n",

Cha, \"Super\" doesn't even get close to describing how seriously \"Rica\" this place is.  I propose \"Holy-freaking-build-a-monument-for-it-Super\" ... -Rica.\"  Our Mamma and Papa GRUB used to hit up this spot back in the day, a random dude at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia told me to hit it up (side note ... Arcadia is like 100 miles from SB ... who is this guy? Or better question ... how ridiculously amazing is this place going to be?), and then when I caught my favorite radio show, The Petros and Money Show (PMS), talking them up ... it was like the holy-trifecta of Good Grub recommendation.  And so our mission to hit up La Super-Rica Taqueria was born.  And when my one year wedding anniversary rolled around, what better town to recommend to my bride than Santa Barbara?  Yeah ...  We can check out the amazing beaches, walk around downtown, take a stroll along the bike path down by the Zoo ... and did I mentioned we might be hitting up a legendary taco spot?  Can you say ... romance?  As you pull up to the joint, realizing there's no sign up on the building ... and the line is out the door ... well, let's just say brace for something epic.  I mean seriously ... it's a hole-in-the-wall if there ever was one, but not just a hole-in-the-wall, but a hole-in-the-wall frequented by Julia Child (sorry, but now I can't get this Julia Child SNL video out of my head).  Gazing up at the menu board, I remembered from my days back as a little kid about their amazingly scrumptious tacos, but is was Money from PMS that lead me to hitting up the Chorizo Especial ...  a bowl of gooey, melted cheese encasing hearty chunks of chorizo ... matched up with a pile of fluffy, hot tortillas to make your own mini-taco-quesadilla-creations.  To our order we added a taco de adobado (aka pork marinated in happiness), an order of chile con queso (for my veggie-loving-wife), and a heaping side of guacamole.  As we waited in line, we got to peak into the kitchen and see the fresh, hand-made-tortilla-making action up close.  Everything we got was pretty much unreal ... the meat was flavorful and tender, the tortillas were out-of-this-world, and the queso ... oh man, the queso.  Let's just agree on one thing ... you better make sure you can tolerate some lactose before you hit up La Super-Rica.  The cheese was thick and rich ... so much that Baby Carlos was pretty much in shock over how good it looked ... not at the table Carlos.  We bathed everything in their trio of dangerously good salsas ... a fresca, a roja, and a verde ... all with a tiny bit of bight and a ton of sweet flavor.  It was a magical way to spend our one year anniversary ... or any day for that matter.  So thank you La Super-Rica ... I can tell we're going to make it for the long hall ... is it two early to start thinking about coming back for year two?  \n",

Straightforward home cooked Italian food. The atmosphere is old school with characters hanging out at the bar arguing over how many jiggers are in a fifth. The food is flavorful and plentiful for not a lot of money. The meatballs are so delicious. Great garlic bread, yummy minestrone soup. New fave!  \n",

I ordered this food under Doordash due to the pandemic. They actually have a very good selection of sandwiches and salads. Of course, I like the sandwiches, because there are some days when a salad just won't do. So far my absolute favorite one is the horseradish roast beef. The meat is so tender I can rip the sandwich in half. Its nestled in between two soft pieces of ciabatta bread. With any sandwich, its only as good as its bread which is the foundation of a good sandwich. This one's perfect and they toast it. Despite that its still soft and chewy. It also microwaves well if you don't want to eat it right away. What I can appreciate is that the calorie count is is posted on their website so you know what your eating and you can custom build your meal. I like to get this with the cucumber tomato salad to keep the calorie count low. However if you want to indulge, they got you covered there too.  \n",

So far each time I come, the menu's different, but they also have interesting menu items on board. This year I came twice, and on my first visit, got their duck wings, tapa style (due to ration and pandemic, it was a way to stay afloat, I'm assuming). The next time I got softshell crab. Soft shell crab is not easy to find, so I leapt at the chance to get it. It was delicious and interestingly plated, sitting atop a slice of grilled watermelon and pickled rinds--different and refreshing! I finished off my meal with a piece of cheesecake. Absolutely love and adore this restaurant as you never know what to expect expect for whatever it is you order, its going to be good.  \n",
              "494096                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This fairly new restaurant, established in 2015, apparently made a big splash in St. Pete's downtown scene, and as a frequent diner in the area, I knew I had to try this place. The evening was clear and beautiful, so I dined outside. No reservations are needed; it's just walk right in. The wait staff were attentive and friendly with me and my dinner companion. Our waitress explained some menu items to help us make an informed meal choices. Most of the items I saw were outside of my typical choices when dining out (instead of my usual regulars such as some kind of macaroni and cheese or pizza, I see spaghetti squash pie, pickled watermelon, etc.) which could either be very good or very bad. The duck confit caught my eye as I've been partial to it lately and it's somewhat hard to find in most restaurants. So, in good faith, I had the duck confit and my companion had fish and \"grits\" (it was more of a polenta, I think). We split watermelon and goat cheese bruschetta for an appetizer.\\n    The verdict? Outstanding! I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the watermelon on the bruschetta. For me, watermelon is meant to be a sweet dish, not savory, but the way it was prepared reminded me of marinated tomatoes. It was also very refreshing after having walked all over downtown to find this place. The goat cheese paired very well for a light finish. Not long after our dinners arrived. It looked beautifully arranged and seemed deceptively small in portion. It was the duck leg on top of the spaghetti squash pie sitting on top of a spear of broccoli. Pickled watermelon rind was on the side (again with the watermelon, right?). I started off by eating the watermelon rind. Having been pleasantly acquainted by the bruschetta, I knew more about what I was in for. It kept a sweet and sour flavor to it, almost candy like. Then I reached for the duck leg and broccoli. The very tender duck leg itself slipped right off the bone. The spaghetti squash pie I saved for last. Not surprisingly, it tasted very much like sweet potato pie, but savory. It was a small piece, however, it got me full relatively quickly. But not too full for dessert. \\n    From the time that I entered the restaurant I knew I wanted the honey black pepper cheesecake after seeing so many good pictures of it on Yelp and reading so many good things about it. I had to know if it lived up to the reputation. Well, dare I say that cheesecake is one of best I've tasted (not sure if equal to or better than the Grimaldi's amaretto cheesecake--hard to choose). The mixture of honey and pepper holds a sweet and complex cheesecake flavor along with a light and fluffy texture as I ran my fork through it. You can't taste the black pepper really, but it did add a bit of spice and heat the same way cayenne complements dark chocolate. The cake sat atop a drizzle of honey which I scrapped off along with forkfuls of cheesecake. It had a piece of honey candy (kinda like peanut brittle) that I munched on at the end that was a nice touch to an already incredible dessert. If I were to come back for nothing else, it would definitely be for the cheesecake. Its $12, which is somewhat a steep price for dessert, but for me, it's worth it. My friend had the cheesecake too and seconds my opinion.\\n   Overall, service and food were impressive. I would describe the interior as a little kitschy, yet modern and industrial, so you could come dressed to impress or casual. A few managers checked on us and asked how we were doing and what we thought of the food. I liked how they were engaging and weren't rushed. There are a few other items on the menu I would like to try, so I know I'll be back soon!  \n",

It's in a beautiful convenient spot right off of Esplanade. Liuzza's is super authentic local nawlins, my dad said he used to party there way back when he was cool ;). Frosty beers and mixed drinks from behind the bar. I got a huge plate of sweet potato fries (maybe one of the only vegan options they have but so good!) and my friend got a grilled cheese and coleslaw. Our snacks came out super fast abs the staff was all really friendly. Highly recommend it!!!  \n",

We crossed the bay via ferry and had dinner before the hockey game. The menu is cleverly constructed and the Chicken Dinner, to die for. We ordered way too much delicious food. Next time we plan to make this our destination so we can bowl and play other games too. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming.  \n",

I order extra spicy and they didn't disappoint me. The sushi my husband got looked like the most fresh fish I've ever seen in a roll.  Excellent!!!  Lunch prices are great, but otherwise seems high.  \n",

We LOVE Jung's. Inside, it has a quaint kinda \"traditional\" American Chinese vibe and intimate seating area. Recently, we ordered and it was delivered hot, fast, and omg was it tasty! My fam and I are vegan so we ordered the veggie Lo Mein and fried rice and asked for both without egg. They both came perfectly vegan (many restaurants will mess that up but not Jung's!).

We were amazed at how lively, trendy and fun this venue was. The Indie Flea Market was open too so there were tons of people scoping out the cool creations. We plan to be back often to chow and enjoy the River Walk.  \n",

Go with the large because thats just the go to size for any person to say.  Even if its just for two people.  Would be weird to say medium.\\n\\n5 stars  \n",

Spicy and addicting! Then the rain came so we chowed on sushi. Highly recommend the \"Pretty in Pink\" specialty roll. Tim, the manager, was pitching in behind the bar and shared lots of stories and ideas with us. Thank you are an awesome afternoon. We'll be back often!  \n",

Their burgers are so great (try the flamethrower burger) and the staff is really friendly. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" which let me donate two free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pick of my food through the app; I thought that was really neat! I'll visit again soon!  \n",

I've had the salmon and the trout here, and both tasted so fresh and nicely prepared. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience. I hope to come out here again soon!  \n",

So the opp presented itself last night when we needed a Romantic spot to dine. Been on the go in this fine city and since we were starving and staying near Frenchmen street, we popped in. Apps of duck and dumplings plus raw oysters were out of this world. We could have stopped with those. But we then did a wagyu steak and veal off the entree list. My partner and I shared everything down to thecrumbs. This meal was fabulous. One of best we've ever had here in New Orleans. Thank you Trinity!!  \n",

My server was great too. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience.  \n",

I was craving wings, so i called and ordered their garlic parm wingz with ranch and bacon cheese jalapeno fries. The food cones pretty quickly. Everything was hot and fresh on arrival. I was very pleased that the wingz were big, meaty and loaded with the garlic crust I've been craving. It still had something of a kick from some of the buffalo sauce. It came with a side of ranch. The fries i really enjoyed because while the fries itself was well seasoned and crispy, it also had cheese sauce and then a skin of white cheese, bacon crumbles, and topped with jalapeno which was the perfect touch. The prices are reasonable for what you pay for.c\\n Couldnt eat it all in one sitting, so ill be saving some for later for the perfect late night craving!  \n",

It was busy! Lots of variety and great way to get some exercise while enjoying retail therapy.  \n",

That being said though, it was first love when eating at Fresh Kitchen which I have heard nothing but good things about. I gave them a try during the height of the pandemic when i had to use Doordash to get my food. All the food there was definitely fresh and top quality. Usually I don't do bowls because I'm not into rice or quinoa and I'm not always in the mood for pasta. Luckily with FK i can customize and control the carb and starch content as well as increase my veggie count. My normal go-to is their four bowl, because it's just the right size for me. Recently, i've discovered that I really love sweet potato noodles, so I go with that and kale slaw as my two bases. For veggies, I do mushrooms (scientifically, did you know that mushrooms and chicken go well together??) and citrus chicken. Today, they were out of the citrus chicken, so went with their baked almond chicken. So glad I did, because the tasty crunch really added another dimension of texture that complimented the flavor. I love to top it all with their delicious creamy white ginger sauce for a cool, mild finish. The customer service here is on point, even when the whole place was jumping with activity and so packed with customers that the line was going out the door. Luckily, despite of that, the line is never long. They offer a lot of desserts and drinks, that I may try at some point when i don't feel like getting my usual.  \n",

I order the thin crust supreme. Im fairly picky about the sauce on my pizza and this comes as close to my all time favorite from home. They are located a little off the beaten path so most don't realize they are there.  \n",

My family and I were so excited that this local spot opened up on Prytania. My dad has been raving about their poboys so he and my mom and I finally all got a chance to try it out. My mom and I are vegan and they were SO accommodating and friendly, it was amazing!! We had a vegan pizza (we were assured they recently changed over to a butter free dough) with artichokes, onion, and spinach. The fries were great too! My dad got gumbo and a 4\" poboy which he loved! Two thumbs way up!  \n",

Moly. Kindred is THE BEST!!!!!!!! 100% all Vegan menu with killer options like cauliflower Mac and cheese, shrimp Poboy, and occasionally on the menu (you just have to ask!) a spicy chicken sandwich to rival and exceed Wendy's Spicy Chicken. Seriously, you will be blown away by everything at Kindred!!! My non vegan bf (he's working on it ) loves everything there and always asks to go back as often as possible.

Today was the first time I got to go in person and even with limitations due to covid, my experience was TOP NOTCH!! There were limited seating areas in the dining room which made for a very comfortable, well spaced out experience. The server, Susan, was absolutely as sweet and helpful as can be! She helped me narrow down what I wanted (which was everything!) and was quick and safe. Susan wore gloves and mask the whole time, and even made doing so look comfortable and easy, which was really nice.  The owner and wonder chef, Caroline, was there too and she personally came out to ask how our meals were. She is so friendly and kind and the food was so out-of-this-world-amazing, it's no wonder this restaurant is a staple in the neighborhood and raved about by the vegan community near and far. The spicy chicken sandwich is to die for!!!!!!!!!! They use their own seitan which is spot on and then cooked to perfection topped with lettuce tomatoes and pickles. I also got sides of cauliwings drenched in tasty buffalo sauce, coleslaw which was so good and refreshing, and the tastiest mac and cheese this side of the Mississippi! I HIGHLY recommend you check it out! Oh and they have daiquiris!!!! I've heard the watermelon and mojito ones are crowd favorites but tbh all the flavors looked and sounded amazing. Can't wait to try one next time I go! Thank you, Kindred for an oh-so-tasty lunch, a wonderful experience, and amazing cruelty free neighborhood restaurant! 12/10 gold stars.  \n",

This is a small restaurant located in a somewhat obscure out of the way area in Town n Country, but looks are deceiving. The restaurant itself looks more like a house with the small interior giving you the impression that you're in someone's kitchen. Seating's limited, however, not impossible for me to get a table and sit comfortably throughout my meal. There's also some seats outside, which is good when the weather is nice. The place was also very clean and smelled good. For my meal, I got the Sopes with shrimp. I've never had sopes before, and I assumed it was like an arepa based on reading the description. However, this was not the case. The sope is a corn cake of sorts, however, outside was crispy like a tortilla chip, inside was soft and chewy like a corn fritter. The melted queso on top gave it a very nice touch. My meal came with shredded lettuce, more crumbled queso, some avocado, and white sauce drizzled on top. On the side was a red sauce that I topped it off with like dressing. The shrimp was right underneath on the cheese. I enjoyed this dish very much, as its something I've never had before. The dish was relatively light, yet filling enough. I had two sopes and the size remind me something of tapas. The two of them only set me back $11 after tip, which is a good deal. My boyfriend, who used to be a die hard Taco Bus fan, really enjoyed their shrimp and beef tacos. Another good choice for me and the boyfriend to enjoy.  \n",

I never knew. I never tasted gumbo in my life. I had dishes that were named gumbo in other cities, but I never tasted true gumbo until I visited the Gumbo Shop in New Orleans. Unbelievable. I want to revisit New Orleans just to take my family to the gumbo shop.  \n",

We were in the middle of exploring the French Quarter and knew that something hearty would boost our energy. Because we wanted to try different dishes, we ordered a little bit of a few common selections.\\n\\nWe had the Seafood Okra Gumbo, the Chicken Andouille Gumbo, and the Jambalaya. They all hit the spot and were well-cooked. During the next visit, I will surely order a full bowl/plate of one of these three. The bread that came with our visit lasted throughout these three cups and went well with each dish!\\n\\nLastly, if you're going to have dessert, we recommend the Southern Pecan Pie. It was the best pecan pie my wife and I have had and we totally would've ordered another slice if we had the time. This was the most memorable portion of the meal and was incomparable to any other pies we've had in the past!  \n",

We got several pizzas, one being thick crust last Saturday. The dough was great and not heavy at all. If anything there was this magical airiness/lightness to the pizza allowing you to enjoy it to the end! Great prices too! Their selection of beer is diverse. We had Dragoon beer, which is also based/brewed locally. The owner, Rocco is wonderful. I had met him by chance on a bike ride earlier in the day and briefly mentioned this pizza place called Rocco's Little Chicago pizzeria. Eating here is not just settling for what is around, eating here is a great experience and Rocco's may have the best pizza or among the best pizzas that I have ever had!!! Boy was I lucky to be at the right place at the right time!! Too bad I could not pack pizzas for the trip back to California. Thanks Rocco for everything!!!  \n",

We made a reservation and it was pretty filled up at the later hours so we were there at five and it eas still packed. Our service however was still outstanding and everyone was prompt and energetic. I kept my meal pretty simple since it was not a cheat day for me so I went with petite filet mignon and the Flemings salad. I really appeciate jow the calorie count eas listed on the side of the menu so I could make smart choices. My meal may have been (reasonably) healthy but it tasted decadent and worthy of a Christmas meal. For one thing, my salad had candied walnuts and dried cranberries in it to give it that sweet and tart crunch. My petite filet mignon I ordered medium rare (I refuse to order it any other way) and was well complimented with the horseradish butter even though the meat itself was alteady buttery. I was pretty full at the end, though my boyfriend enjoyed a nice dessert. Perfect place to for a special occassion whether ready to indulge or trying to stay on track.  \n",

It was my first time coming here and I noticed when I first walk in it was a rather lively atmosphere of folks tasting wine. They also have a display case that showcases some of their own chocolates, which I have to take note to try on a next visit. I ordered the gnocchi carbonara (I love carbonara and I love gnocchi, so this was a treat!) and their shrimp, lobster, and crab soup. From start to finish my meal was outstanding. I loved that they had warm pretzel bread that tasted like it came out of the oven just moments before reaching our table with whipped butter. The soup was slightly more on the thinner side than I usually want in a bisque, however, it had a generous portion of meat. The gnocchi carbonara was delicious and filling with the right amount of meat and sauce with shaved parmesan. For dessert I went with their sea salt caramel crème brulee, which was light and creamy. The service here was great. Our waiter George was very attentive and rather enthusiastic in discussing our menu choices and even helped guide me on my drink selection (since I'm not a drinker). I'm still not a wine drinker though, but the food would have me come back.  \n",

They've always been helpful with suggesting Vegan dishes and their cocktails are  so so good. I went with my best friend who was visiting for just a few hours. She got the brown butter gnocchis a snack and loved it. We both had a few cocktails, French 75s and Moscow Mules. We sat upstairs on the balcony and watched the NOLA world go by on Jackson Square. It was the perfect happy hour!  \n",

Pino was our server and did a great job   We had the ossobucco  and seafood linguini.  Both were excellent.  They also did half orders of pasta for our kids.  Everyone was happy and the seating on the sidewalk was really nice.  We will return again.  \n",

I came here on a reservation for one due to what I predicted would be a heavy Gasparilla weekend. I right to do so because the place was slowly getting packed when I arrived and wait times were a good 20-30 minutes long without reservation. Maggiano's has a charm that looks classy and captures something of an old world restaurant feel with the red and white checkered table clothes and low lighting. The lounge music gave the overall atmosphere a nice touch. I had their Maggiano's salad for a side to start. What can I say, but something magical happens when you bring blue cheese and bacon together? The nice thing is that its light enough so I didn't get weighed down prior to my dinner. Now, unfortunately, the bread looked so fluffy and inviting, that I had to help myself to it, only to curse myself later because of the size of my entrée and that I had on skinny jeans. The one thing I forgot about Maggiano's is the large plates all their large entrees came with. Fortunately for me (and my pants; for a change I didn't have to loosen my belt) looks were deceiving. My chicken and spinach manicotti was actually rather light; generous thick portions of chicken and spinach, and the pasta was shrouded over it like a veil. All of it was lovingly smothered with a rich asiago cream sauce and topped with diced tomatoes. The sauce had a nice balance of creaminess and density so it was neither soup like or heavy. The asiago flavor was actually rather light so it didn't overpower.There were three pieces of it, and I managed to eat each one on the separate bread plates (so if it took leftovers it wouldn't look as if its been through a war zone when I put it in the box). I actually managed to finish the whole meal and was too full for dessert. I've heard the cheesecake here is incredible, so I'll have to remember to get it on my next conquest.  \n",

On my return trip here I got a light take fettucine alfredo with shrimp and chicken! Even though it was lighter on fat and calories,  it was definitely NOT light on flavor! (The dish was still about 820 calories, so even with this dish, nosh wisely. Other meals here have around 900-1600 calories, so this is definitely a cheat day outing regardless of what you get!) Speaking of indulgence, they have the BEST bread I've ever had! It was soft and hot with the right amount of chew and crunch. Do yourself a favor and say YES to the bread basket or you'll be very sorry. The nice thing is that Maggiano's will give you a portion of your pasta meal to take home to enjoy which is a great value!  \n",

This place had just opened up around this past spring or so. My first impression was actually \"Meh, it's just chicken salad, so what?\". However, I frequent two restaurants in the plaza and curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to check it out. This place makes about 15 different varieties of chicken salad that they serve you in a variety of ways, including number of scoops with choice of side (side choices were rather decent), or sandwiches. Upon entering, I was greeted by a few cheerful, welcoming employees, who were also helpful when time came for me to make my selection. I chose a single scoop of the Olivia's Old South chicken salad (which is a more traditional style with eggs and sweet pickles) and a side of pasta salad. My order came rather quickly. I had six packs of wheat crackers, one pickle spear, and a snickerdoodle cookie. Every item on the plate was delicious. The chicken salad tasted very fresh and had the right balance of chicken to mayonnaise ratio. I enjoyed scooping it up with the crackers, then had the last of the chicken salad wrapped up in the lettuce leaf it sat atop of (WOW!! It made a great wrap! I'll eat it this way from now on!). I finished off my treat with the pasta salad, which was lightly dressed with feta cheese and olives. I didn't eat the cookie though. I gave this to my boyfriend, who told me it was very good, so I'll take his word on it! Up at the front counter where you order, they sell each flavor of their delicious chicken salads and their pimento cheese salad in take home containers. I couldn't help eyeballing the pimento cheese salad. I'll probably take it home to go on my next venture out there!  \n",

That being said, my new favorite is definitely their Sassy Scotty, with the ranch, cheddar, and bacon.  If you want a good meal, I strongly recommend getting the sandwich (croissant is my bread of choice!) and get a side of their broccoli and bacon salad. Or get pasta salad or grape salad, if you want something different. The meal comes with their soft and tasty frosted sugar cookie. Of course, if you don't want to make a meal of it, just get a scoop with crackers.  \n",

Plus we had the best Kurt's Italian sausage for a snack. Counting the days until next Saturday!  \n",

The food was quality/quick and the staff was great. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience.  \n",

My whole family enjoyed everything we ordered: from chicken parmesan to homemade ravioli. The staff was also really great, and my server was so polite and professional. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience. I will be back!  \n",

This is a rather unique restaurant that offers both curries as well as pub favorites and British specialties. From the inside the décor conjures up images of pubs and restaurants how I would picture it. Some notable dishes I've had before was the mild red curry with shrimp, vegetarian Shepard's pot pie (highly recommended), pierogies, cream cheese stuffed jalapeños, and baked brie. For my last visit, I got their English pasty at the recommendation of my awesome waitress when I was not sure between getting Sheppard's pie or the former.  I was glad I got the pasty (turnover) because it had this wonderful thick brown herb gravy and it was wrapped in a flaky dough. Come to think of it, I'm something of a sucker for all bready items that are flaky, and this did not disappoint. The filling itself was wonderfully seasoned beef with veggies and potatoes and reminded me of the lumpia (Filipino eggroll with ground beef, chestnuts, peas, and raisins--sounds me but it is amazing!!) filling my mother used to make on special occasions. The turnover was rather large, but I was able to finish it. This dish comes with a choice of either rice or fries as a side--I highly recommend getting the fries over the rice, you won't be sorry. I loved how it came with peas so I can feel a little better about eating my vegetables. I got extra gravy for $1.5 (soooooo worth it!!! I put it on my fries when I got home and was in heaven!). For a finishing touch, I got their bailey's Irish cream cheesecake. It didn't taste like Bailey's to me...just regular cheesecake with Bailey's drizzle on it and I'm not sure if that's how it was meant to be, but it was still a good creamy cheesecake. With the large variety of foods to choose from, you and your company are bound to find something you'd like! Out of the all the food I've had there, I think what I had today was my fave so I would get everything I got again!  \n",

My family members enjoyed their dishes too, which included some fish (I think salmon?) and a chicken piccata dish. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" which let me donate two free meals just by snapping a pic of my food; I thought that was pretty cool. I will definitely come here again in the near future!  \n",

Smells heavenly when you walk in, if heaven to you is a \"real\" Italian kitchen. Didn't have a resi but didn't have to wait long and Cal was the best waiter. He recommended the best wine and the food was excellent. Would be my regular spot if I was closer. Will recommend to everyone going to Philadelphia. Full stars.  \n",

Stopped in while driving to Thousand Oaks from SLO. Service was great, they were super fast. Got a beer while we were waiting outside. There are 2 tacos per entree but they were stuffed  as they came with sides (rice, beans, salad) so totally filling. Thanks!!  \n",

The bar takes up almost the entire first floor ...somewhat impractical.  The bartender was great! He gave us a little history about the church and how it became Marsha Brown's.  Took a peek upstairs ...very interesting!  \n",

Two people can eat two handmade authentic meals for under $10! The staff is always super nice and the food always tastes great. Best hot sauce in Reno. So glad we live somewhat close!  \n",

I was very impressed with the elegant décor inside and outside. The cuisine is not quite the typical Italian restaurant food, but it has a good selection if you want to either stick to your basics or steer from high carb and fattening dishes. I came in for the early dinner in which $15 dollars got you a appetizer, a smaller size of the main course, and a smaller size dessert. This was a very good deal considering the amount of food you get that would not leave you feeling sick and overstuffed at the end. For my three course dinner special, I chose the house salad, tortellini carbonara (even though that's not the official name on the menu, but that's basically what it was) and they gave me a petite cannoli for dessert. The salad was a decent size, and very light, so I wasn't overly full by the time the main course came. I really enjoyed the Tortellini Romagna (carbonara) as it had a different twist to this pasta dish. The tortellini was light coated with the sauce and was bursting with ricotta. The peas and prosciutto were added a perfect touch to the meal. I didn't get to choose my dessert, but I did love the mini cannoli which was small enough for me to enjoy and savor. Good place to go for either a casual day out or intimate dinner date.  \n",

Today was our lucky day. We took advantage of the happy hour pricing. Who can complain about $3.50 well drinks and house wine? We also scored on the early bird dinner special. We had the shrimp with linguine and the salmon. Both were scrumptious! Thank you from your newest fans!  \n",

I really enjoyed the appetizers that I tried, my Nigiri sushi tasted really nice/fresh, and my girlfriend shared some of her roll which was really tasty. The ambiance is really upscale and the service was great. The restaurant also uses a phone app called GiftAMeal, which let my girlfriend and I donate 2 meals (each!) to a food pantry- just by snapping a pic of our food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience. I shall return soon!  \n",

In my opinion, this is pretty much the best restaurant in NW Reno.\\n\\nThe food is amazing. Staff is super attentive and friendly. Have never had a bad experience here (been here 50+ times). \\n\\nMy favorite entrees include the Muy Especial, Camarones a la Diabla, fajitas, Camarones Culichi, Camaerones con Tocino, and Enchiladas Suizas. For starters, you can't go wrong with Queso Fundido and their fresh guacamole. \\n\\nI also always get an order of the Chiles Toreados (grilled jalapenos)!\\n\\nTop the order off with a Michelada or Skinny Margarita and you have the perfect meal.\\n\\nBest of all, their to-go orders come in aluminum containers, so your food is always piping hot after you drive all the way home.  \\n\\nA+++  \n",

It's been too long since I've last had sushi, so I decided to go ahead and give this place a try since I'm in the area. I notice that it has a very beautiful and sleek interior. Somewhat quiet, but it had a few patrons in. The service was very attentive, courteous and friendly. I'm glad they did not rush me at all. I ordered my normal favorite pairings. Salad and sushi roll, but this time ordered soup as well. I started off with their ginger salad. Salad was exceptional and what I would expect, though I love that the ginger dressing all had a thick texture so I could evenly coat the fresh salad veggies with it. I followed up with their miso soup that had strong flavor in the broth and was generous with the tofu. Then came my roll, the rather aptly named Screaming Orgasm, which is a cooked, baked roll with salmon, krab stick, scallions, and its wrapped in seaweed and topped with spicy mayo. This roll has always been a favorite of mine at other sushi places and this roll definitely delivered! It wasn't heavily overwhelmed with the mayo and I loved how the salmon was wrapped around the outside. It fell apart as I tried to pick it up with the chopsticks, so I was less than graceful eating it, though I enjoyed it all the same. I finished off my meal with their sweetened iced Thai coffee with cream. It was my first time having iced Thai coffee. The bold coffee flavor went well with the sweetness of the cream, so it satisfied my sweet tooth. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in the area for my cupcake!  \n",

The staff was very attentive and helpful in our entree decisions. Highly recommend the Tandoori mixed and the Tikka Masala. The Kashmiri naan was so yummy we ordered a second batch to take home. We love that this was the first Indian restaurant in St Pete!  \n",

I watched the chef, and she was meticulous about her process and quality control. Really impressed. The flavor was very good. While waiting, I saw a sandwich leave the counter and it was really well done.  \n",

It's located in the CBD near some other nice restaurants and things, but this place is an amazing dive bar. Plenty of space, indoor and outdoor seating and several bars. The event I went to had so many fun vendors set up around Ugly Dog like axe throwing, dunk tank, and tug of war. Staff seemed super friendly and on point! I will definitely be going back! Highly recommend you check it out!  \n",

We stopped in to sample the award winning cocktail and she gave us a heads up about their recent Tampa HighBall Craft Cocktail win. Its name is Field of Dreams and it was decadent!

They have pasta, salad, sandwiches, and coastal inspired dishes. For today's visit, I decided to deviate from my usual pizza and pasta fare and opt for sone different. I feelin' a little like tex-mex so I picked out an app and a small plate. I went for their chicken club egg rolls with their street corn small plate. For my drink, their mango strawberry spritzer and of course, key lime pie for dessert. The spritzer is refreshing, especially for the insanely hot, humid weather we were having with a light taste of mango and strawberry. It is about as close to a soda as I will ever get (havent touched the stuff in several years). My street corn came next. It made me realize how much I really love corn with the creamy, but lightly sprinkled feta over it that melted into the corn when stirring it around, giving it a nice bite. I sopped up the remainder of the cheese with the sourdough it came with. Finally, my egg rolls came out, six MASSIVE pieces that came with two kinds of dipping sauce. As a word of caution, unless you are sharing it, do not get this unless you are having it as your meal (which I do quite often with apps). It looks small, but man is it filling. Between the crisp bacon, creamy avocado and melted cheese all wrapped up and deep fried, my mouth was in heaven and my belly satisfied. It went great with the ranch and the spicy sauce so I divvied up the rolls accordingly. I was pretty full at the end of the meal, so I went ahead and got the key lime pie to go to enjoy for home. It was a nice, tart creamy finish to a great meal.  \n",

The menu items do come and go, as they switch up their offerings depending on what's in season, but I always manage to find something I like. Some of the offerings they have dont even sound healthy, but shockingly, they are. I'm talking about their meatloaf (which they improved immensely, and I'm a sucker for their cauliflower mash) bbq beef with mac n cheese, and pumpkin cheesecake. That's right. Pumpkin. Cheesecake. So light, creamy, and rich, it actually manages to RIVAL its unhealthy full-fat counterpart. It provides a nice hearty three forkfulls (cause i may be kinda a pig, but not a slob) and finish great with black coffee. My other fave is their bbq beef mac and cheese. Tender, sweet tasting, hearty pulled bbq beef with burnt edges and creamy mac and cheese fills me up and satisfies me. This dish is so good it has me wondering what the point of a cheat day is if my normal work food is just as good if not at times better???!! They also have fresh breakfast entrees that I like to get for my Sunday \"morning brunch\" even though im not brunching and im going to work, but im not feeling bloated and weighed down. There's a large selection to choose from there. Love their sweet potato pancakes with bacon the most, along with their french toast and banana oatmeal bake (which is rather unique and original!). The new packaging makes the food last forever, which is a big plus, and you still get a discount for bringing clean packages to recycle. What's NOT to love???  \n",

The brunch was really great, regarding my friendly server and delicious food. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" that let me donate 2 free meals just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience!  \n",

Again, it was Gasparilla day so the place was pretty empty and quiet, but we were greeted right away by our friendly server. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and there are big screen TVs on the walls which entertained my boyfriend for a little while before we were ready to order our food. I got boneless garlic parmesan wings and broccoli cheddar bites, while Rob got bone in wings. The food came out nice and hot. Rob (who's usually a fussy eater and writes off places with the SLIGHTEST transgression) was happy with his wings. I haven't had boneless wings in forever, so this was a nice treat. I loved how the wings were juicy and not at all greasy, unlike a lot boneless wings I've had in the past. As great as the wings were, for me what wowed me were actually the broccoli cheese bites! When I first ordered it I wasn't sure what I was getting and thought I would get a floury piece of deep fried broccoli with some cheese in the batter. Instead what I got was this amazing hot gooey, velvety mix of broccoli, bacon (nice surprise), and cheddar all held together in a crispy shell. Just think of the best broccoli cheddar soup but a lot thicker inside fried batter. I would definitely come back for another visit for the broccoli cheese bites, but Charann's has a lot more to offer. I didn't try their cheesesteaks that they're famous for, but they do have a huge variety of other food try.  \n",

It was a busy and packed New Year's Eve at Armature Works, so I decided to stay put and get something to eat myself. We were lucky enough to score some seats at the bar which also was a deciding factor for me to stay and eat. My boyfriend of course got ramen, which I'm not that into, but i did think their chicken app looked pretty good. I also got their pork belly bao bun, which my boyfriend ordered and we splut it. Everything we had was fesh and tasty. I really loved the chicken and the Sriracha sauce. For one it was flavorful, but not at all greasy. The bao bun had the right balance of juicy meat and crisp veggies. I remembered getting these at Anise gastrobar, which I really miss dearly, so it was nice to get my hands on them again. All the staff there were really nice and in a jovial mood along with the crowd. I was also impressed with how quickly the food came out. Rob was cery impressed wirh his ramen, so I think i might have to make a return trip there for the ramen and give it a chance!  \n",

It is within walking distance in the event we cannot find an item at our store. Everyone was very friendly and courteous.  \n",

The staff also seemed really nice and hospitable. The restaurant also uses a phone app called \"GiftAMeal\" which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry, just by snapping a pic of my food through the app; I thought that was really neat. All around great experience!  \n",

Our server had a great sense of humor and the venue was busting out at the seams by 11:30 in the morning for lunch. Luckily, we showed up right at opening time and had our choice of seating areas. The portions are humongous and very tasty. Thank you for a wonderful experience!  \n",

In fact, I will be there today to watch football games.  This is exactly what Nashville needs. A high-end amazing sports bar, with a really cool vibe.  The staff is awesome and the managers are really attentive and help out in any way possible.  I am so excited this place is in Nashville. Five star venue and five star service  \n",

We had an office lunch here today and everyone loved it.  The setting in the Upham Hotel really adds to the great food and service.  We had the meatloaf, pasta, and chile dish, all of which were good.  I think we had 5 baskets of bread since it was that good.  Try to get an outside seat on the veranda.  \n",

I really love Italian food, and I'm always open to going to new places, so while I was out getting a cupcake at Sprinkles, I thought I'd stick around and try them for dinner. Forbici has a beautiful, modern vibe in the interior, serving up both classic and new world Italian. It was incredibly packed today, so I decided to go ahead and have dinner at the bar, which does offer full service. The seat was nice and comfortable and I was acknowledged immediately by my awesome server. The moment we made eye contact, she greeted me with a smile, a drink of ice water, and my menus. As much as I love unconventional innovative Italian food, i decided to go classical. Lately, as I've gotten older my tastes have seemed to simplify, and to be honest, it's not a bad thing since plain and simple does not equal boring and mediocre. Case in point, i decided to go with a meatball appetizer and some cacio e pepe spaghetti. Its my answer to the classic spaghetti and meatballs, only somewhat modified, since im not quite a spaghetti and meatballs kind of girl. The meatball app is rather small and simple: two, soft, tender meatballs sitting atop some of their red sauce. You can add some ricotta for 2 extra, which I did because i love it and it added more flavor and texture. The app was delicious and i love the portion size: big enough for me to appreciate, small enough to leave room for more food! I have been DYING to eat some cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) since i've heard so much about this simple dish (and its shocking that as much Italian as I've eaten, I've never had it before), i was excited to get my hands on it. They offer half or full portion size. I went with half, and was grateful that I did. The spaghetti was al dente, wonderfully coated in butter, and generously sprinkled with parmesan cheese and pepper. It had this great flavor that reminded me of macaroni and cheese, but very mild with a nice kick in the end from the pepper. Overall wonderful place and service, a big shoutout to my server who despite was slammin and busy never missed a beat from start to finish!  \n",

For those are not familiar to the CSC concept, they offer an insane variety of chicken salad. Before, I would have never fancied myself a chicken salad kinda gal, but one taste of this seemingly simple concept and I was seriously in love. I'm huge fan of pretty simple lunch food (but ONLY if done right) and the quality of CSC shines bright. For me, I'm a savory kind of gal, so I go for either Sassy Scotty ( bacon, ranch, cheddar) or Kickin Kay Lynne (almost the same as Sassy Scotty, but hot). I pair this up with a croissant to make a sammich (my usual) and get their delucious broccoli salad as the side (perfection with bacon bits and cheddar cheese with some kind of dressing that i cant identify that's so good i tip my head back and drink what's left in the cup) The meals come with a cookie,but yoy can buy a decorated frosted cookie or a marshmallow treat if that's not enough. They also have monthly dessert specials that's worth noting. What i love about this location is that it's so easy for me to get to. It's always clean, and the staff here are always polite and prompt. Definitely one of my regular spots now.  \n",

Their food is consistently amazing and completely 100% vegan (THANK YOU VEGAN WIT A TWIST!!!). I just got a chance to stop by in person for the first time and wow!!!! What a great space! They have pens so you can write on the walls and there's TONS of inspirational stuff from before and after Covid started. It was fun to read and take in everything written by fellow loving vegans while we waited (not long!) for our food. I've had their burgers before (da pressure burger is to DIE FOR!). This time, I went with my sister on a Tuesday, so of course, we went with the variety of tacos for Taco Tuesday! They had 4 different kinds of tacos, topped with amazing sauces and pico, each was delicious!! They are not offering dine-in right now, so we took our food to-go and enjoyed it at home. Service was friendly, helpful, and quick! Also try their watermelon cucumber lemonade, it was soooooo good, the BOMB! Wear a mask and enjoy the walls. Six stars if I could.  \n",

I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend for a special night out. We were seated and greeted quickly by our server who was friendly and attentive. I loved how he was able to answer questions I had about some of the menu items. For my dinner I had the arugula salad with warm goat cheese, lobster bisque, twin lobster tails, and truffle macaroni and cheese. I had the red dragon mojito to wash it down with. The salad was fresh and crisp and very lightly dressed with champagne vinaigrette. The goat cheese gave it some added flavor and texture so it was a bit more filling. Then the lobster bisque came out. We're served a piece of bread with lobster meat in a bowl before the soup is poured on top. I've had lobster bisque at many places, and I can say that each place does it very different. Not my favorite, but it was very good, very much on the creamy side. What I can say was some of the best that I've had is the twin lobster tails and the macaroni. The lobster was very large, thick. The wait staff deshelled it for me. The meat tasted very fresh and sweet. I skipped the butter that it came with since I didn't feel it needed it. Their truffle macaroni and cheese won me over as well. It had the strong truffle flavor to it, but it wasn't thick or heavy and had a light white cheddar flavor. Their red dragon mojito was the perfect companion with the whole meal. It was sweet, crisp, and had a generous amount of mint and muddled strawberries. I'm a very light drinker, so this was perfect for me. My boyfriend is a very picky eater himself, and felt that was the best meal of his life. My only regret was that I was much too full to have their dessert at the end. I'll have to make this a goal for my next visit though. The meal was $266 and with tip I paid $300. It's a lot, but I feel that this place was worth the splurge.  \n",

Almost.  As I got ready to head south to the opposing cheesesteak establishments I elected to seek the advice from a native.  She turned my head.  And gave me a different instruction.\\n\\nThanks to her it was Jim's to which I adventured, to South street which was like Duval or a tamer Bourbon, replete with shops and establishments for the libation, street art, music and characters.\\n\\nThe line for Jim's was maybe 40 people long and didn't stretch too far around the block.  That the glass window allowed watching of the preparations was both entertaining and maddening.  I was sooo hungry.  I hadn't et since the Potbelly's in Midway.\\n\\nPotbelly ....\\n\\n(make a Homer Simpson sound)\\n\\nWhite roll, steak of some variety chopped finely and tender, slather one spatula of mayo, three slices of provolone (I didn't go cheese whiz, couldn't), grilled onions, peppers, horseyradish and voila - a Lipitor commercial.\\n\\nIf I'm going to die from the sandwich this is the sandwich I'd like for to kill me.  \n",

I discovered this restaurant today on accident.  Ive had donburi all over including Japan and their Ribeye donburi was the best.  It was a lunch special so hopefully they have it at dinner as well.  \n",

This is a straight-forward, American, home cooking kind of a restaurant right by the university in Tucson.  My husband got the Fried Chicken Platter and I got the Route 66 Bacon/Cheeseburger.  (Remember this place is 100% vegan!)  The service was super friendly and fast and everyone was loving their food and enjoying the place it was such a happy restaurant - but the best part was the food!!!  We are soul food loving ppl (me - vegetarian, him - omni but with veg leanings,) so this food was right up our alley!  The fried chicken platter was so good that my husband said it was the best fried chicken he'd ever had real or otherwise (and he is a connoisseur!)  I don't even usually like fried chicken (real or otherwise) but after trying his chicken, mashed potatoes and stuffing - I liked it so much we ordered another one to go for me (the first time we have ever done anything like that btw!)  My burger was very good also but hubby definitely won dinner.  Their 1000 Island dressing is amazing also btw, as was the peanut dressing we had on another salad in the take home meal.  We suggested they pair the fried chicken with the waffles for their brunch menu and I hope they start offering that.  We also sat next to another couple who had ordered the Fried Chicken Platter because after going vegan the husband was craving fried chicken.  He echoed my our thoughts that this was indeed the perfect (real or not) fried chicken.  (Love all the friendly people in Tucson and AZ!)  We cannot recommend Lovin' Spoonfuls highly enough!  If we had another day in town we would definitely go here again - maybe twice!  \n",

Never had been here before, but had a great time with a friend. Good wine, great variety of muscles and other eclectic food, something for everyone.\\n\\nThen? Piping Hot Donuts? Late night on a Saturday? Yes, they win an award for these. WOW. Go just for the donuts, if not anything else. Not the fanciest, not the most comfortable seating, but a good mix and cool spot to check out...with donuts and drinks.  \n",

The location is perfect because it is right in center city making everything accessible and walkable. The hotel itself is beautiful and very clean. Everyone working there is so nice and accommodating. It was very easy to check-in and out with little to no contact with the front desk. They also have delicious breakfast and restaurant downstairs in their lobby. I highly recommend this hotel!  \n",

Couples, families, and a place for singles at the bar upstairs. Had meatball app with a few of the unpretentious local IPA, etc. loved the aroma of the truffle pie but the MB did the trick. Cool staff, and eclectic music in the background. Big screen upstairs runs some cool B&W footage and adds to a relaxed atmosphere. Nice place. Check it out.  \n",

This is my second visit to this restaurant and both times they have been wonderful. Where do I begin? I love the exterior of this restaurant, which reminds me of a gothic castle with the tall black gates, so its a great place to go for Halloween (which happened to be around the time I went both times). The interior has a lot of character as well; high ceilings, beautiful chandeliers and carpeting. My sister swears that the place could have been a theater before. Of course, no restaurant is worth its salt without good food, and this place delivers! For this visit, I had the deviled eggs appetizer and filet mignon as the entrée accompanied by sautéed mushrooms and spinach. My meal was accompanied by crispy onions which went well with my filet mignon and parmesan encrusted roasted tomato. My sister and I loved the deviled eggs appetizer topped candied bacon. My sister was very pleased with her spinach salad and she's pretty hard to please. Customer service here is top of the line. She was nice enough to take a photo of me, my boyfriend, and sister, who was visiting. I would rank this as one of the top places to go when in Ybor.  \n",

New owners are a husband and wife team.. Super nice and always friendly. Just had a Ham, egg and cheese wrap. It was awesome! I also had a cinnamon roll that was great. Don't tell my wife though because I'm on a diet, lol! You won't be disappointed..  \n",

We had an out of town guest for the holiday and stopped by finally. The venue was packed because of the tree lighting in the park but everyone on staff was super nice and efficient. The holiday lighting is especially delightful!  \n",

The pizza that I had was really great and my server was super friendly! The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" which let me donate two free meals just by snapping a pic of my food; I thought that was pretty cool. I will definitely come here again in the near future!  \n",

They're conveniently located in Erin Rose (super fun local French Quarter bar) and they have a vegan sweet potato poboy that is SO GOOD. I always recommend Killer Poboys to friends and family. Check out the Flippingtons Day holiday inside Erin Rose, if you can. It can get crowded but it's a great spot for a quick bite and a drink in the quarter.  \n",

We were lucky enough to receive free appetizer coupons and happily tried this bar. We had the fried pickles and were delighted. The owners do an excellent job of marketing the bars. We are now loyalists! Thank you!  \n",

The nice thing is that it's a good opportunity to try some thing new. One thing is consistent with this place though is that they have rather unique dishes that could suit any taste. For me, I usually get some kind of pasta (which is always excellent). I started off with the cauliflower and bleu soup which I thought was different. Tasted amazing, like a cheese soup, but it was cauliflower, and the little bit of bleu cheese added more complexity to the flavor. I regret not getting a bowl, but I had to save my appetite on my meal. I really love gnocchi, and see that this was sweet potato gnocchi, I knew that dish was what to get. I ordered it custom requested though, because I added duck confit to my meal, and this does not normally come with duck. I really love duck and its kinda hard to find for some strange reason. Its an $8 dollar upcharge, but I think its more than worth it. The flavor from the duck confit blended so well with the sweet potato gnocchi, bacon, and brussel sprouts that it almost tastes as if it was meant to be this way. This was also the first time I sat outside coming here, and it was right at a prime beautiful location to people watch and pet dogs, so I did enjoy dinner with a view.  \n",

So far I have been here twice and the food quality as well as service has been consistently excellent. This last trip I had was even better though. I arrived earlier than their dinner hours and so they had a different menu until 5pm. I asked the waitress if I could order from the dinner menu anyway because I was looking forward to specific dishes. She was very gracious and said she would ask the kitchen, and they were willing to let me order the dinner items. My lamb meatballs and vegetable farfalle with goat cheese arrived promptly. The same dinner I had a year ago was just as good as I remember. I loved their lamb meatballs! They were soft and filled with greek cheese. There was Siracha sauce on the plate that I dipped them in. My pasta was fresh with a variety of vegetables in it. I usually don't go for nuts in the pasta, but the walnuts they had in it gave variety in the texture of the dish. All complemented with goat cheese and cream sauce that was rich, but not too heavy. My waitress checked on me often. I love the accommodating and cheerful service from this restaurant and would strongly recommend. Wish I had a dessert, but I was too full. Pretty sure they are excellent though. Maybe next time.  \n",

The skinny holiday menu had ample selections to satisfy our foodie expectations. The appetizers and entrees were generous and delicious and the dessert, to die for! Normally, we have leftovers to enjoy the next day but we couldn't resist gobbling every last morsel. Thank you for a memorable night!  \n",

I got a combo meal here which had a lot of tasty Chinese food! The staff was friendly and I got my food quick. The place also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience.  \n",

Love their salsa and homemade chips.  My favorite items are the Steak Ranchero when I am really hungry and the Chile Verde tostada when I want something lighter.  Great prices as well.  Most of the menu is less than $10.  \n",

This is a great semi upscale place to eat that won't put too big of a dent into your savings account. I decided to go for simple yet tasty today and decided to get a lobster tail (single) with au gratin potatoes for the side (which I havent had in YEARS due to mostku picking mac n cheese) and asparagus for some tasty veggie nutrition. For my drink I had a ginger mint lemonade. First off, it was pretty hot out, so I was so greatful for the the refreshing cold drink. I was surprised how crisp and light the taste was of the lemonade, not at all heavy hitting with sugar or overwhelmingly sour. Probably the best lemonade I've ever had. Dinner came ratherbpromptly after. I enjoyed the sweet tender lobster tail that tasted fresh and detached easily from the shell. The asparagus was nuce and firm, well seasoned in butter so it was a good light, yet filling companion. I live lobster, but U have to admit that my favorite part of the meal was the su geatin potatoes that I saved last. Dense and cheesy, I almost thought it was mac and cheese! Very happy with their quick friendly aervice too and hoping I can go back when the social distancing is over.  \n",

They have a great variety of pizzas, salads, subs, and apps to suit pretty much every taste. The vegetarian dishes in my opinion are much better than vegetarian options at most restaurants. The food I get is always hot and fresh. My favorite pizza to get there is the Gourmet white pizza (I'm a sucker for white pizza). I've had white pizza at many places and love their version of it. Theirs has feta cheese and is heavy laden with mozzarella and a blend of other cheeses for a unique taste. The pizza crust is soft and topped off with more parmesan cheese. A personal pizza has four slices and I polish this off with no problem. Now hands down their spinach and artichoke dip is by far the best that I've had. Why?? Well, the cheese makes the difference. There's a thick skin of the mozzarella cheese on top of the creamy layer of dip underneath. Goes very well with the toasted bread its served with. If you want to go healthy(ish), get the stuffed Portobello cap with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, and mozzarella. It sits on top of a fresh bed of greens with balsamic drizzle. Just a fair warning: this is not the place to be if you're in a rush, at least not when dining in. Service is always friendly, but it can be a bit slow. The last two times I came here it took a while for me to be seated. This depends on the day and hour you go and their staffing. However, the food does come out in decent timing (about 5-10 minutes) once you get a table. So if you're having a lazy day and want good food to nosh on, bring your appetite and be mellow.  \n",

If I don't get pizza, I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip. I've had spinach artichoke dip in many places throughout the years, and this is actually the best in my opinion. Why??? Because of the thick cheese crust it comes in. Reminds me of pizza with no crust. They supply you with a lot of tasty garlic toasts to go with the dip. I somehow run out of bread (which is another shocker, because normally I run out of dip before I run out of bread or pita chips) and I end up spooning the rest of the dip. Another plus because I am NOT a fan of tortilla chips and more often than not this would stop me from getting dip. So if you love pizza and bread, this is the place!  \n",

Working in the restaurant business, I understand there is probably a hold up for a reason.  Low on servers, kitchen backed up, dishes running behind, whatever.... I understood and it wasn't a long wait.  \\n\\nNow though, there are a lot of parties being sat at once, it's gonna be crazy.\\n\\nSurprisingly, we were greeted right away.   \\n\\nOur drinks came right away.  He gave us time to think things over, took our order and kept us informed through out our short wait time.  He spaced things out prefect.  We never had to ask for anything.\\n\\nI honestly could go on and on about our server and how effin' perfect he was....  but I'll spare you all your time (so you can go read other reviews) and just tell you, Rashad was FANTASTIC and made our visit the best Chili's visit ever!    \\n\\nIf I could just take him with me everywhere and have him serve me that would be great!   Wait....  \n",

If I want a sub, there is Eegee's, Hogue House and a half dozen Subways in the neighborhood.\\nSo one day, we decided to try it.  Even sat in the parking lot for a few moments deciding whether or not to go in...\\nGlad we did.  \\nThe owner explained the menu, was super nice, polite and very positive and smiley.\\nOne of us got the All You Can Eat buffet with coffee and I got the bacon plate with orange juice.  Both meals, DELICIOUS!  So good, we came back the very next day, (01/01/2016) getting two different meals, again, delicious.\\nOver the following few weeks, we've been in for breakfast another 2-3 times and for dinner too.

What a deal! We ate one slice and have another for later. The owners are really nice and friendly too.  \n",

Just WOW!!!! Addis is a MUST TRY in NOLA. It's off the beaten path and so worth the trip! We just had the MOST AMAZING meal at Addis Nola!! Prince and the whole team there are absolutely fantastic. They're attentive and helpful, kind and speedy and the food is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD! I can't even describe how amazing the food is!!!! The mushroom tibs are seriously, indescribably, incredibly, amazing. We got the Veggie Combo and they made us a huge array of amazing authentic Ethiopian dishes, (cabbage, lentils, chick peas, beets, greens, red lentils, a cold \"villain\" dish that was amazing, and more), plus they even made us the mushrooms tibs specially on a Wednesday (they are usually offered as a special only on Mondays). They ALSO made us an extra traditional sauce/side (the dark reddish one in a bowl in my photos, sorry I can't remember the name). It felt like we were a guest in a beautiful home, the ambiance and experience are comfortable and delightful. Prince helped us order and everything he suggested was easy and perfect. We started with an order each of the lentil and collard green Sambusas, which were crispy and incredibly tasty. The Sambusas came out quickly and piping hot! The veggie special was served on a beautiful large platter atop a huge piece of injera with an additional 8 huge injera rolls (there were 4 of us, so this was PLENTY for us all)! The injera was spectacular, best injera I've ever had in the U.S., hands down. Prince was so informative about everything we ordered and we loved every bit of it. We even got an extra special taste of Ethiopian coffee and coffee roasting ceremony. All the staff was pleasant, happy, and helpful! Everyone was wearing masks and we were pleasantly spaced out in the restaurant. I highly recommend Addis for vegans and non vegans, best Ethiopian food in the South!!  \n",

Everything there is completely vegan and OH SO GOOD! The artichoke cakes, nachos, and southern fried poboy are my ULTIMATE favorite! Their chocolate avo milkshake is SO GOOD, sometimes I get two and freeze one for later :) The atmosphere is fun, hip, and clean! The staff is always friendly and efficient and the food is on point. The Borneo jungle theme art is super cool and gives the whole restaurant a lively vibe!! If you have time, stop by the vegan boutique nextdoor to make your Seed experience even more fun and full of vegan-ness!! All around great great place!! I highly recommend Seed for vegans and non-vegans alike!  \n",

I chose to come out here with my dog Friday evening since the weather and location were perfect with outdoor seating and places I can take Blueberry. I arrived somewhat late for my reservation, but luckily they still had my spot. The hostess was kind enough to watch Blueberry for me so I could go to the restroom and enjoy the rest of my meal. For today's dinner, I picked a pretty simple, yet outstanding selection. I love Italian food, and I love cheese, so the choice was pretty obvious. For my appetizer, I went with their provoleta supreme, which is melted provolone, bacon, tomatoes, all gloriously blended together in a small cast iron skillet. It came with a small basket of very fresh breads that I used to make mini grilled cheese sandwiches. For dinner I had their porcini ravioli. I thought about getting cheese, but then realized that might be too heavy considering that I was already getting cheese for an app. If you love mushrooms, get this. The ravioli is stuffed with mushroom and on top of the dish is more mushroom. It was topped with a shockingly light alfredo sauce and grated parm. Overall the meal itself was pretty filling, but still managed to be shockingly light since for one the portion sizes were reasonable, so I had no problem finishing whatsoever. The overall quality of the food was also outstanding as was the ambiance. I would definitely look forward to coming back with my dog.  \n",

Since everything was closed due to the pandemic, I thought now was a great time to get this place for takeout and stay home. They have a relatively large and varied menu so they do have something for everyone. I hot their white pizza and some jalepeno poppers for the appetizer. The jalepeno poppers were nicely seasoned and not greasy or oily with ample cream cheese in it. The white pizza (personal size) had feta, ricotta, and a good amount of spinach in it so I feel like I got a good veggie quota for the day in. It was pretty good, although the crust was a bit drier and bread like than most, but still overall pretty good. Despite the crisis going on, staff remained nice and polite when getting our orders. This is a great place to go if your in the mood for some classic comfort food but without the frills. Glad its right in my neighborhood.  \n",

The bread is great, ingredients are fresh, and you have to try the Maryland fries. I have to give a disclaimer that I ate at the airport location. Mandy was the cashier who helped me, and she was awesome...super friendly! Totally made it worth having a layover in Philadelphia for two hours. All I have to say is if the airport location was this good...the stand alone Resturant must be Philly Heaven!!!!  \n",

Their pizza, pasta, and other tapas-style appetizers all hit the spot. Our server was super helpful and really nice. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" that let me donate 2 free meals just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience! I will return!  \n",

The establishment catches your eye simply driving down 4th Street. Our bartender/waiter was super friendly and helpful. The meal was absolutely delicious. We plan to return during Happy Hour and to sample the entree offerings. Yum!  \n",

Love the potatoes cooked on the grill.  Next time I will add feta.  Can't wait to go back and try the spicy Bloody Mary.  \n",

It's been a few years since I've been here, but I did notice a few changes that I really liked. For one, it looks like they have more options to pick from (I'm not a rice eater, and I recalled a lot of their main dishes have rice). For another, they have more healthy options, or at least they clearly label how many calories their dishes contain. Since I came out here on a non cheat day, I opted for what seemed healthy: their jackfruit tacos. Comes with a side of tomato salad. All this sets you back some 600 calories. To my surprise, the tacos were very good: generous on the filling, which had a good variety of veggies on it, and had a lot of flavor from the sriracha aioli. I should point out also, that this was the first time I've had jackfruit and I did enjoy the taste and texture of this meat substitute. It came with a side of marinated tomato salad which was a nice touch. The whole meal was filling and does not leave you feeling deprived like a lot of \"healthy\" options do. Just be warned if you are vegan that I don't think the sriracha aioli is vegan, but I love it just how it is.  \n",

The staff and owner are awesome!!! You can tell the bartenders and servers enjoy their jobs so it makes the whole place feel like a family bar. Plus, they have the BEST location and when the bar gets full the party just spills out onto Royal Street  Drink and food prices are reasonable for the quarter. I LOVE their Bloody Mary's (BONUS: they don't use beef broth, like some other bars do  so they're totally vegan, PHEW). They do it up right with the pickled string beans and/or okra and all the fixings. I love 801 for a casual sit down and drinks to go. Two thumbs wwwaaayyyy up!!  \n",

I found the food to be excellent and the staff to be kind/helpful. The brisket is so tasty, and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone good! The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience.

My server was friendly too. All in all a good experience here. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat too.  \n",

The whole dang place is cute.   I wish it wasn't so far from my lilly pad cause I'd be here all the time, no joke!  \\n\\nEverything I ate was fantastic!   The bacon was tasty, scrambled eggs yummy and the home fries, PERFECT!   We even tried to share a pancake but the rest of the food was very filling.\\n\\n\"T\" gave great service and even answered all our silly questions with a positive smile.\\n\\nI WILL BE BACK - I'll even make a special trip  \\n(it's across town for this safety circle gal!)  \n",

Great place to go for classic, simple American fare. This is one of those places that always leaves me nostalgic, bringing me back to my college days when my parents would pay me a visit and take me out here for brunch and on those Thanksgivings past when i would pick myself up some turkey dinner and pie. While the food itself is most definitely nothing fancy, its always hot and fresh when i order it, and notably not greasy, which makes it a popular spot for seniors. My personal favorite meal is always the savor size turkey and dressing, which you can order a scoop of mashed potatoes for your side (because what ELSE would go well with turkey and dressing??). I always get a bowl of extra gravy on the side, which they are more than happy to serve at no extra charge. You can go for biscuits or bread (btw, they make a wonderful pumpkin bread as well as their delicious banana bread!) though lately, I've been going for the biscuits. Soft, fluffy, and melt the butter on contact, it's a nice treat to get before the meal. Like i've said, the food is not at all greasy, so the turkey dinner itself hits the spot without making me feel sick. I like to get a whole pumpkin pie to go for the next few day's worth of breakfasts (don't judge).  I always request they pre-slice, which they are always more than to do.  \n",

My favs are blackened grouper and salmon.  So FRESH!!!  I could eat their sautéed spinach every day!!  Lobster Cobb salad is AMAZING with huge fresh pieces of blue cheese.  House made blue cheese dressing... YEEEEEEES!!!  The hubs loves the happy hour prices.  It's the perfect spot for a dependable nice dinner out or an evening of celebrating.  \n",

I've been eating here for years, and although I've tried out a lot of menu items on the list, I do have my absolute favorites! For me, its between their Manchester Farms Quail dish and the Nantucket Scallops. The quail is definitely much leaner than chicken, and has a gamey complex flavor to it that chicken lacks. Their quail is stuffed with mushroom risotto, spinach, and bacon, so this meals stands well on its own, but I would recommend complimenting it with their butternut squash soup for more fall flavor. My other favorite is the Nantucket Scallops. These scallops absorb the brown butter flavor of the sauce and it is somewhat similar to their caramelized sea scallop. I love the ravioli that comes with it, as its light, sweet, yet rich in taste. The arugula is a nice finishing touch that I like to mop up the rest of the sweet sauce in, which balances out the bitterness. Of course, these two items are for very limited time, so I make sure I get these as much as possible. Also notable is their lobster and fresh mozzarella flatbread, which is luckily a mainstay in their menu.  \n",

I've noticed that many menu items are no longer low call (475 cal or less), but that's okay as the calories are listed besides the item. This helps you make informed choices regardless of what you get. I got the lobster flat bread and paired it with the arugala salad with mushrooms. The flatbread itself was perfectly crisp, tender generous portion of lobster, a sprinkling of mozzarella, and some shallot for added crunch. The salad was great too. Normally arugala is a bitter vegetable, but they balanced theirs quite nicely with the truffle dressing and shaved parmasean on top. Waiter was very on point; friendly, professional, and always made sure my water glass was filled. Their dessert offerings are astounding but not over filling as they are served in shot glasses. Great place to indulge if healthy is not your thing and does not necessarily leave you wanting more. I skipped dessert this time, but I've had them before and can vouch for it. Definitely great food of highest caliber in my opinion and look forward to going back:)  \n",

Great place to go with a small group, as everyone can browse among the vendors and pick out the perfect thing for them! Then you can reunite and find a nice outdoor table to enjoy your meal together. They have great vendors, all local and all tasty. I highly recommend checking it out!  \n",

Doormet offers pizza, sandwiches, salads (my kind of place), and they cater. So far I've only had their sandwiches. I've had the Bavarian and their Rustic that had prosciutto and chicken. Both the breads and the meats on their sandwiches are so soft I can rip them in half with my fingers with no effort. They use high quality ingredients and sauces in tasty combinations. The Bavarian has roast beef with bacon and horseradish sauce. But my favorite is definitely the Rustico sandwich. I love the mix of pesto, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto. Comes with chips, but I like to substitute this with their tasty orzo pasta salad, which is an upcharge of $2, but with the portion that I get is not a bad deal. Their food is on the pricier side; I would compare this to Panera. Good option to go to if you want a tasty unique sandwich.  \n",

I have been a regular here for three years and have acquired some faves. I would go with their half portion deli sandwich with half size house salad. I substitute the chips for side of their orzo pasta salad to round off the meal. Their seemingly plain deli sandwiches are made wirh the most tender cuts of meat and are petfrctly nestled on a soft roll. I can easily rip the sandwiches with my fingers with not alot of effort. My other favorite is half size salad with a cup of their tomato bisque soup. No exaggeration, they make THE best tomato bisque I've ever had with the rich tomato flavor and hearty croutons in it. They do offer specials each month that look very interesting and I do make a note to try. Definitely in the bucket list is their mac n cheese and wings.  \n",

I am a fan of gumbo and my seafood gumbo was awesome. My server was really great too, and my whole party enjoyed their experience. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" that let me donate 2 free meals just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. My friends got to donate meals too. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience!  \n",

Barcelona Tapas is a SPECTACULAR culinary experience! The owner and chef there is inspiring and oh so good at what he does! We got so many amazing tapas and the bill was so reasonable, seems like we would have spent double with all the amazing food we had!! The service was top notch and the atmosphere is tasteful, casual, and beyond pleasant. Our server took time to explain each tapas to us and how best to enjoy them. We shared a pitcher or sangria which was some of the best I've had! We had a great date night here! There was a family celebrating with a big table and a few friends out on group dates. I highly recommend Barcelona Tapas!!! Vegans and non vegans will love it!  \n",

It tasted really fresh and flavorful, and the staff was very kind. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" which let me donate two free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pick of my food through the app; I thought that was really neat! I will be back!  \n",

It's right along St. Charles and blocks from beautiful Coliseum Park. There are tons of beers on tap, bartenders are so nice, friendly, and quick! There are two really nice indoor seating area (one on first floor and one up on second floor) plus a huge back patio AND a balcony with one of the best views of St. Charles around! The bar food is fantastic and all their small plates can be made VEGAN! I'm talking tempura fried mushrooms, hummus plate, cauliflower hummus, fries! The mushrooms come with a really tasty sauce! Avenue Pub is a GREAT place to enjoy the view of St. Charles and the laid back local vibe that NOLA is famous for. Did I mention it's open 24/7!?!? If I could give 6 stars, I would!  \n",

We entertained out of town business clients on a bustling Friday evening. My Berries and Bubbles martini was concocted table side and was enlightening to observe and divine to imbibe! We had the lobster roll sushi and lobster bisque to start. I didn't want to share. Then our really cool waiter helped us make wise entree choices. My Chilean sea bass and my partner's wagyu were incredible. We usually run out of room for dessert but we just had to sample the infamous butter cake. OMG, between the four of us, there was not a single crumb remaining. Ocean Prime, my new BFF!!!  \n",

Finally, we decided to give it a go on Valentine's Day. As predicted this place was packed so we made sure to make a reservation months advance. We were ushered in right away and were placed in one of the dining rooms. The interior was classy and gorgeous, each table covered with a classic white table cloth. Our server was prompt to get us our drinks and shortly after our order for that evening's dinner. For my meal, I ordered the lobster bisque to start, followed by the twin lobster tails. My boyfriend got the French onion soup and surf and turf meal. The lobster bisque arrived as a large bowl with clumps of lobster meat. They pour over the rich bisque on top of that. The soup was rich and creamy with a wonderful lobster flavor and what I detect was sherry. Then came tge lobster tails. The tails were already seperated from the shell so they took a good lot of the work for you. They were nestled on top some corn and little potatoes with a spicy peppery cream sauce. The lobster meat was sweet to taste and was a good contrast to the chili pepper sauce. It seemed like a small amount on the plate, but i actually got quite full at the end. My boyfriend finished off his dinner with their famous warm butter cake topped with vanilla ice cream. I took notice how the cake seemed to jiggle a little and sorely regret how full I was, but my boyfriend managed to finish it and said it wss very good. I'll probably get it on my repeat visit there on the not too dustant future.  \n",

Close enough to walk to and from, even with a couple of margs down the hatch. TJ, the bartender, provided spot on recommendations for food, drink, art, activities, etc. we plan to be regulars here. Awesome venue!  \n",

I always get the veggie burrito with rice and black beans, lettuce, pico, and guacamole! Great super flavorful burrito!!! For ~$3 you can make it a combo w chips and dip (salsa, guacamole, or cheese) and a fountain soda (love their ice)! They also have some of the best margaritas you can find in the Quarter! Their bar is in general, awesome. The staff are super friendly and helpful!!! I always have a great interaction with the line chefs and this time particularly, Jessica, at the register was a total delight! Everyone made my experience super awesome. I was in and out so fast (on a quick lunch break) and my burrito was sooooooo good!!! (I ate it all before I even snapped a pic ‍) I highly recommend Felipe's for all your local French Quarter Mexican dining and drinking needs! Enjoy!  \n",

My wagyu beef ribeye was absolutely amazing and my server was very knowledgable of the menu and food. The restaurant also uses a phone app called GiftAMeal which let me donate 2 free meals, just by snapping a pic of my food through the app! I will definitely be back!  \n",

They have an amazing selection of wine and decent beer/liquor selection too, plus they have the best little deli lunch spot in the back! My dad and his buddies love to go there for wine and sandwiches and I love to stop by for something quick on the way to friends or family. The staff is always super helpful and happy to be there. I highly recommend you check it out if you're in the area!  \n",

We tried the doner kebap as well as a chicken wrap.  Both were great.  The staff was very friendly and gave good advice about which sauces to choose.  I recommend the garlic yogurt sauce as well as the habanero. Everything was awesome.  \n",

The last thing Main Street needed was another college kid beer bar, and where Kildare's used to be this place feels like a high end \"for everyone\" spot.

You will have a hard time deciphering what you would like to have because there is not one item on the menu that is not some of the best you've ever had.Last time when I visited there it seem like it was so far out in the country but with all of the growth it was just minutes from the city. It is a must see when visiting Nashville  \n",

Food and hospitality were top notch. We had a nice visit from the very fashionable manager, Margaret, who made our evening very nice. Service was friendly and efficient. Our waitress helped steer us in the right direction of getting the correct amount of food for our party of three. My roasted red fish with nduja was unbelievable and the banana zupa inglese for dessert was a highlight.  \n",

The prices were very reasonable and the menu was enough to feel Nashville flavor yet still be health conscious. Easy one pager menu so you can make a decision and keep moving.

Notable foods are crawfish, fried oysters, and gator tail. Some of my favorite dishes they have is definitely their Crawdaddy Mac n Cheese. Its a rather large portion of glorious, creamy, delicious macaroni and cheese crowned with a generous heap of blackened crawfish. In a world of seafood mac and cheese (and I've tried a lot out there) this one is KING. They also have in my opinion the BEST key lime pie around. I also love how I can catch a show and listen to some down home Americana bluegrass music after (or take my food with me). There's really no place like it in the Bay area.  \n",

How good your experience is depends on what you get though. Recommended items are the chickens wings, oysters, crawfish, and gator. Gator and crawfish is not offered in too many other restaurants that I know of, and they do this well. Also they have the best key lime pie in my opinion than anybody else. (Most other key lime pies I've had taste artificial, loaded with hard whipped cream, overly sweet or overly sour...blech.) For today's visit I had the gator tail and crawfish tails with dipping sauce. I love how their fried foods are not greasy and the breading is well seasoned. They also have this awesome sauce that comes with the crawfish that have some Cajun kick to it and its housemade. Their dinners come with two sides and I got coleslaw and hushpuppies. Their coleslaw is great: lightly coated with dressing dusted with paprika and spices. They are even a music venue where you can walk over to their \"SkipperDome\" and catch a live music act.  \n",

The Injera was great!! We got the veggie combo and it came with plenty of injera and all the vegan Ethiopian dishes on top were simply delicious! It was quiet and comfortable when we were in there and the veggie combo for just $16 fed the 2 of us till we were stuffed!!! Lots of vegan options!!  \n",

The pies are 12 inches, but they're thin crust so its easy to tackle in one sitting if you come in hungry. As much as i love the pizza, i need to confess that the one thing i drop by here for more than anything is actually their cheesecakes. Massive, creamy, and packed with flavor, these beauties come in a huge variety of flavors that rival Cheesecake Factory--but fresh (not that I'm hating on Cheesecake Factory). Throughout the years I've had many: Amaretto, Irish Cream, Red Velvet, Coconut Caramel, Strawberry (my new fave since they no longer carry the Amaretto), pumpkin, and eggnog (another one I really wish they had kept). Nevertheless, i always find something I like.  \n",

Grimaldi's has wood fired New York style pizza, and they use water that's supposed to be similar to the filtration system in New York to give it a more authentic New York taste. One of my personal favorites are definitely their white pizza with garlic, though I doctor it up with ricotta cheese for added creaminess and texture. My other favorite is their Quattro Formaggio (four cheese) which is also a white pizza. I might like this one slightly better than the former because of the gorgonzola cheese in it that gives it an extra bite.They also offer flavored teas depending on season. The one I got today was strawberry watermelon with chunks of watermelon in it, so it was even more refreshing. Of course, my trip here can't be complete without their New York style cheesecake for dessert. These cheesecakes are the creamiest, smoothest, and freshest tasting I've ever had. My favorites are definitely their coconut caramel cheesecake as well as well as their strawberry cheesecake. Make sure you eat light before getting here or you won't have room for it. These cheesecakes are pretty big.  \n",

The walls are beautifully fluid, and the dining room is minimalist perfection. The lighting is soft and sleek. Our fish was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the seasoning was absolute perfection. We loved the dessert of ricotta cheese with passion fruit syrup. The attention to taste and presentation is absolutely amazing!  \n",

Just WOW! I love how many vegan and veg options they have! My cousin and I went and got giant salads that were OH so good! We also got the pickle plate which had a nice spread of pickled treats. They have a nice little outdoor seating area and a chill atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place for vegans and non vegans alike!  \n",

They both had amazing flavor and tasted very authentic. The restaurant also uses a phone app called GiftAMeal which let me donate 2 free meals, just by snapping a pic of my food through the app; I thought that was really neat. I will definitely be back!  \n",

I had a double tequila mule served in a ginormous cup. So good! We slit the BBQ burger and finished with a \"Happy Ending\": a coated deep fried Snickers bar sprinkled with powdered sugar. Simply amazing!  \n",

I met my friend and her husband out here with my boyfriend (beer and wings guy, so it took a lot of pleading to get him here with me). First, I was very impressed with the beautiful, clean interior of the restaurant. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and were able to guide my meat eating vegan naïve boyfriend of what kinds of foods would suit his palate. All three of us (friend's hubby only got water) had the Avo Blt. My friend and I each got it with the Seminole corn chowder, and boyfriend got his with kale chips. The food was outstanding, and somewhat surprising with flavor. Their eggplant bacon had the crunch and texture of real bacon, just much leaner. The sandwich came in a flatbread which looks like a cracker, however, it was tender and held up very well as I ate my sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised how the corn chowder's chilled temp did not put me off at all! It had a nice little kick from the pico de gallo and the cashew cream gave it the thickness and consistency of traditional corn chowder. Honestly, I think this tastes better than traditional, and I've had a lot of soup. My friend agreed about the corn chowder being superior and my boyfriend enjoyed the sandwich enough to want to come back.  \n",

(My childhood CEC had one wooden climb through gym and a ton of arcade games with that ski ball in the far back)   Point is.... it's nice and cool, (inside from the heat!) bright, but LOUD and I was waiting for some giant mouse to greet us.  Instead some sweet, polite young lady explained to us what we could do and where we could sit if interested since we announced it was our first time.\\n\\nWe peeked around.  You have a choice of sitting at the bar or around the bar at tables or booths.  This is all open to also seeing the game area.  There are also tables and booths in the quite 'restaurant type' area and I noticed two rooms off to the side for meetings or parties; Very Cool!  We decided to sit in the quite area so we could still hear each other talk.  Along the walls are TV's playing the music videos that are on surround sound.  Like MTV again; back in the 80's.\\n\\nWe all ordered then looked around the place.\\n\\nWhen you first look at the game area, it doesn't seem too large but when you actually walk into it, you might get lost for awhile.\\n\\nNone of us played any games or looked at the prices.   I did notice that you need a card to play the games?  Maybe not.\\n\\nThis place is NOT FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN.   \\nThis is meant for older teens/adults.  \\nDon't even torture the little ones.\\nLet dad take the younger ones to Chuck E Cheese or Peter Piper and mom can beat some arse on some Space Invaders with the teens.\\n\\nOur server, Stephane T was super patient with us. \\nAwesome service.  Ask for her.\\n\\nAll and all we had a good time.   Next time we'll stay longer and put our initials in that PacMan game!  I remember when that game first came out!\\n\\n(I'll add a picture somewhere)  \n",

The portions were generous enough to share between us. Very sweet to have a neighborhood deli!  \n",

I've been here during the Downtown After Dark Halloween party two years in a row now. The inside is sleek and elegant in appearance with comfortable seating, so I was able to alternate between people watching while eating and drinking and going on the dance floor with ease. They have wonderfully crafted drinks in a full liquor bar. I very seldom drink (like maybe 2-3 times a year, normally a max of two drinks each time),but I've had three drinks and a shot here before. I got a great buzz from them, but no hangover, so they pass my unofficial and unscientific test of quality. They have small bites of food available that go great with the drinks, which is perfect for late night. Among the foods I've had here are their charcuterie selection (not the best, but very good!!), deviled eggs, and high end bar snacks like the Stinky Bunz. If I can think of one thing to come here for, it would definitely be the Stinky Bunz. I would describe them as mini fluffy clouds of heaven. Actually, they are soft buns filled with variety of filling of your choice. So far I've had Chinese BBQ and Panko Shrimp. You can either get these as a duo or a trio, but I suggest Trio because they are so tiny and they are addicting to eat! For my last visit, I had the panko shrimp which included a little bit of mayo and slaw. I paired this with their delicious deviled eggs (wasabi lobster) and a light beet and goat cheese salad. The food is a little pricey, but quality is very good. The best part for me is I can order a few small plates and make a decent meal of it. Not to be missed if out and about it downtown!  \n",

We always think about branching out to a new spot BUT....  We always find our selves back at Yard House! With a reliable menu and a super sweet staff- it's really a no brainer!

Really enjoyed the shabby chic atmosphere with farm table seating large enough for group seating. Garlic wings AMAZINGLY tasty; honey wings very good; Cubano panini was memorable especially with sweet potato fries; lamb gyro was impressive; great burger; tasty chicken panini. We didn't go with a smoothie or freak shake but definitely plan to in the future. Looking forward to a visit to Tavro for dinner in the future too!

You can also sit at the counter.  This building was the old Cocos, interesting to see how they changed things.   \\n\\nEveryone was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful!   Food was very tasty.    A bit pricey, expect to spend some money, but worth it at least once to check it out.   I'm SO GOING BACK to try one (or two or ALL) of their desserts.    \\nI could also see going on a date night here.  \\n\\nOur server was EXCELLENT but so were all the others running around, really on top of things.    Again, I LOVE IT!     \\n\\nP.S.  Hazelnut Cream Rulez ;)  \n",

So many dynamic flavors beautifully plated.  We had the porky pops (soy garlic flavor) & shrimp appetizers.  The pork spareribs are deep fried and lighted seasoned/splashed with garlic & soy.  Not too sweet or salty.  The shrimp arrived in it's little stone bowl with toasted olive bread slices. Shrimp as so tender and the bread was too.\\n\\nWe also ordered the bulgogi dol sot bibim bap and it was also very good. \\n\\nPauleen's service was exceptional.  She's so energetic and friendly.  She anticipated all your needs and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy.  \\n\\nOwner was very nice and made sure we got a seat, even though we didn't have a reservation.  We will make a reservation the next time we're in town.  \n",

Everyone was super friendly and nice.\\n\\nSmall parking lot, but with the closed down gas station next door, there is plenty of parking :)\\n\\nThe bathroom is a 1-potter and super small and you may have to step over a few people to get to it but it's at least INSIDE the building.  I've noticed a lot of little cafes have their bathrooms outside.\\n\\nFood was delicious and perfect on the prices.\\nI have to remember this place is here and come more often!  \n",

I came out here with some friends to eat and play. What was the nice surprise about Dave and Buster's is that their healthy options are actually pretty good. I noticed that there were a few things that looked great that weren't just salad. I opted for the Ancho Caesar Grilled Chicken Lettuce Wrap because I do love the combination of avocado, chicken, and bacon. They absolutely did not disappoint. It wasn't overly messy to eat and was actually pretty filling for a light bite. The parmesan cheese added the right touch. I went ahead and bought a game card for $3 and put $12 on it for 60 points which actually went a long way. It was 1/2 off price for games, so that would explain it, but still a very good deal. There were a lot of different games I could choose from, and I didn't have any wait time. The service there was good; we had an issue with the air hockey table and they were responsive to the issue right away. To me, this would be a perfect place to spend a fun date night with some drinks and good food. Next time I'll probably get a drink and try one of their less healthy apps and game with my boyfriend.  \n",

I highly recommend the hot chicken poutine, which gives you enough hot chicken and cheese to feed two people.  It also cures one of my biggest complaints about hot chicken, the lack of cheese.

              "2039498  The fog rolled in yet rested in Carpinteria. We were foolish to not stop for breakfast in Ventura. As soon as my family and I drove into Ventura, California, we saw the Amtrak train famous for the views of California. My son had never ridden an Amtrak train, especially one so grand as the Pacific Surfliner that rides the waves along the coast from San Luis Obispo to San Diego. My son jumped on the Surfliner in Ventura and rode with his mother up to Santa Barbara, where I drove to pick them up. But we had to return to Las Vegas for Super Bowl Weekend, so we turned quickly south without breakfast in Santa Barbara. My son was famished. Hungry, he asked repeatedly for me to pull the car over, so we turned west on Linden Avenue in Carpinteria. The beach resort town of Carpinteria was gorgeous, magical, still covered in fog, you could feel mist from the waves hitting your face, and the restaurant near the ocean that we pulled over to eat at was called Esau's Cafe. There were people standing outside, eating at new tables set up outside, because every local seemed to want to eat breakfast at Esau's Cafe each Sunday morning. Since then, we have returned to Carpinteria many times just because of the great dining experience was engaged in at Esau's Cafe. Crab Cake Eggs Benedict with fresh baked biscuits, muffins, seafood tacos with fried fillets of fish, my son had the grilled calamari steak sandwich with a combination of hot onion rings and french fries - his first calamari steak ever. The platters around us were impressive with waffles, pancake layers fluffy thick inches off each plate, and as I took a tour of our colorful surroundings inside the restaurant a large bake pan had high, thick biscuits cooling right next to the over, which I cannot get out of my mind as I write these words, because the biscuits smelled golden brown with butter, milk, flour, and yeast prepared to perfection. I wanted to return to order a dish off the menu using the biscuits, because the oven pan made them appear so delicious. The beach is a temptation. The small town is nearly hidden. I would have never stopped in Carpinteria unless my son ordered me to out of a desperation for hunger. Nor would I have found Linden Avenue, the location for Esau's Cafe. The walls are painted bright colors with surf boards and menus written out with colorful chalk. Nothing is saturated as you have in a fast food diner off the freeway with plastic wrapped egg sandwiches slapped with processed ham. Homemade dishes. Home cooked breakfast crafted by proud chefs. Even the cooks and staff walked around with confidence, because they were proud of the delicious dishes they were serving. The beach was relaxing. By the time we finished our first meal, the fog had burned off giving way to the sun. My son collected sea shells on the sand of the beach right next door to Esau's Cafe. My wife walked in the waves with her pants getting wet after taking off her socks and shoes. Our family returned to Carpinteria the very next week after driving seven hours from Las Vegas, Nevada, because the temptation of Esau's Cafe after waking up in Las Vegas was too great to resist the drive to find a resort hotel to sleep in so that we could dine at Esau's Cafe for another Sunday morning of searching for sea shells polished by the ocean waves next to the restaurant that continues to bring us back to Linden Avenue each time we need to engage in an exodus out of Nevada's dry climate. Dine at Esau's Cafe if you travel to Santa Barbara, Oxnard, Malibu, you have to eat at this Esau restaurant even if you have to take the Amtrak train. The Pacific Surfliner Amtrak train stops two minutes away by foot from Esau's Cafe. I tell you this because you can feel like your on a second honeymoon by stopping in to eat and stay the night in Carpinteria from San Diego to Santa Barbara. That is what I may do this weekend now that I remember by writing about the breakfast adventure.  \n",

Had the pleasure of going to Nada last night. The general manager Tim and his staff are awesome. The chips and salsa are the best in the city hands-down. Our waiter was fantastic he was nice and friendly, we really enjoyed our experience. I will continue to go back to Nada multiple times. I enjoyed everything about it.  \n",

This was one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted! The restaurant also uses a phone app called GiftAMeal which let me donate 2 free meals, just by snapping a pic of my food through the app; I thought that was really neat! I will definitely be back.  \n",

I like the place.  It's cute, country home type and clean.  The food is great, service was great, and the prices are pretty much the same as any other breakfast joint.  \\n\\nThere is also a small gift shop when you first walk in.  Very cute with reasonable prices.  I bought a bunch of birthdays cards from here a few years ago.  Lots of nik naks and sports stuff.  \\n\\nThey also have a business conference room if you want to do your business there ;)\\n\\nI need to stop by more often.  \n",

Veggie Village in Nashville is great vegan and vegetarian Caribbean Dining and Catering. The restaurant is so freaking COOL! Gail, the owner and all around wonderful human, has decorated each of the several dining rooms in different fun decor! The food is to DIE FOR (but no animals had to die ). I had the special, Fish Friday vegan fish sandwich and Caribbean beans and rice they were both AMAZING. Chef Ridiculous is THE BOMB. He came out to meet us and had the energy of a firecracker! He customized my meal to be super hot and spice, which I LOVE. You HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE!!!!!!!'  \n",

The bathrooms and dining areas are for the most part clean. They are also pretty well stocked with my favorite pastry and lunch items regardless of time (which is a big plus for me because I tend to come here late). Their food comes out fresh and quality is consistent with what I would expect at a Panera. I recommend the You Pick Two lunch option which offers meal for less than 600 calories (I recommend the Green Goddess Cobb salad with a cup of broccoli cheddar soup. Get the French baguette to soak up the left over soup in the bowl!) You can even just order a half salad without order you pick two if you want. I like ordering myself a bagel to go with the salad for a well rounded meal. Staff is also friendly and go around to collect trash when you're finished with your meal, which I don't really see at other Panera locations. Keep in mind that this is not a drive through location, so if you do come here, maybe plan an errand or two at the nearby shops.  \n",

I placed a carryout order for 30 people and not only was it timely and accurate but delicious too! Managers Janet and Corey were great to work with as was the staff. Highly recommend for quality food and great service!  \n",

Ribs are crispy and well-seasoned.  The brisket is tender and flavorful with a nice char.  I also liked the dry rubbed wings a lot.  \n",

Finally decided to try something new and I've heard they were owned by the same folks who run Ulele's and The Columbia, so I knew they had to be very good. The outside is small and a little unassuming, but the food was anything but. They give you large portions and let you pick what you want. I'm not big into rice, so I chose the shredded chicken, side of plantains, and a side salad. My boyfriend, normally a very picky eater, went with the picadillo, black and yellow rice (surprised me since he's not normally big into rice either) and some plantains. For dessert he had flan. Both of us agree; you can really taste the love in the food. The chicken was moist and tender and simmering in a light sauce. There were peppers and carrots added in there which gave it a nice touch. The salad was pretty good for a side, and I loved how they also had shredded carrots added in, since most side salads are disappointing at best. Of course, the plantains made the meal for me. I loved the caramelized slight crunch savory sweetness that I expected and hoped for. It definitely went very well with the chicken and was more than enough carb for me. My boyfriend felt that the picadillo was the best hands down he's ever had, and he's had his fair share of picadillo. It was his first time ever having flan, and he didn't care for it, but like the flavor of it. For the amount of food you get, the price is more than reasonable. I especially love how its a stone's throw away from where I live.  \n",

Wowowowoowow!!!!! Their vegan rainbow pizza is literally the best vegan pizza I've ever had! The vegan jalapeño cheesy bread is insanely good too. Dining in at G's is lovely, their staff is friendly and helpful. They even have a completely vegan menu, just ask to see it! I've also ordered G's on UberEats ($0.49 delivery fee), and it was quick, easy, and accurate. I even got $1 off bc I said wasn't \"rushed\" and it still came within the hour. 10 stars if I could!!  \n",

But honestly, if you don't have little kids, it doesn't matter!\\n\\nI love the friendly staff, clean restaurant and fresh, hot food!   \\n\\nI will continue to come to 'this location' rather than the over packed, never any parking, far too many people other location.  \n",

The food was refreshing and my server was really nice! The place also uses this free phone app called 'GiftAMeal,' which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pick of my burger through the app. i thought that was a nice touch. Overall great experience!  \n",

I love how there's a huge variety of games that anyone at any age or skill set can enjoy. My boyfriend is a hard core gamer while I only dabble occasionally with beginner level. Some of my favorite games are the connect four basketball shoot, Walking Dead (shooting zombies), Jurassic Park (shooting dinosaurs), and virtual bowling. So far today was the first time I also got food here. Its a great idea to have dinner or a light bite so you don't have to travel far for a good time. They have a relatively good selection on their menu that's pretty standard: sandwiches, flatbreads/pizza, salads, wings, tacos, quesadilla, and burgers. I loved how it was not all grilled food with no healthy options like I normally assume places like this would have. I actually went with salad which sounds basic and safe, but hear me out. The salad had a rather unique mix of dried cranberries almonds and brie cheese on top of spinach. The brie cheese was what sold me since I dont see this often in a casaul eatery.I had grilled chicken added to it for extra protein. The salad was fresh and delicious, though rather large but mainly on account of the spinach. At least I got a large amount of green in my diet. My boyfriend had a pepperoni flatbread which looked good and he enjoyed it. He also had a bottle of beer. They're not a full service liquor bar, but have a goid selection of beer. I did notice a few other things on their menu I'd like to try, but I definitely would have the salad as my default next time I come out here.  \n",

We waited 2 hours in 90 degree just to eat this chicken. I had the half chicken with Mac and cheese and collard greens. It was amazing. The chicken was so tender and delicious. Loved it. Would definitely go back here no matter how long the air is.  \n",

I got both a sandwich at HOT and a dark platter at medium. I preferred the hot, as the flavor of the sandwich was banging. If all you know is chic til a, than get ready to have a spiritual awakening. Also tried the banana pudding and the peach cobbler. I preferred the peach, but ate half of the BP. Check out the pictures.  \n",

Besides that nifty outdoor tiki bar on the beach, the incredible view of the water, Whiskey Joe's has two other things that nobody else does (or at least is VERY hard to find). I'm talking about gator bites and beer cheese soup. Odd choice for a meal, but it's all I wanted. However Whiskey Joe's alone is an experience in and of itself. The decor is cool and offers a decent amount of seating where you could pass the one hourish wait time. I enjoyed admiring the fish tank and listening to some music while sitting in a nice plush chair. It was a busy Friday night when my boyfriend and I went, the sun was setting behind the horizon and people were rapidly come in and out in what seemed like droves from post pandemic restlessness. Bear in mind that Whiskey Joe's is valet parking ONLY, so either come prepared with cash or learn to pay via QR scanner. The forty minutes flew by quickly by the time they texted me for my table. Even though the pandemic is basically over, everyone was diligently wiping down the table tops. The menu was also QR scan, but I'm not as savvy with my smartphone as I should be, but they were more than willing to accommodate to me and give me a takeout menu to order from. I had to get my beer cheese soup and gator bites. It's been too long, and not many places have these items. The gator bites came out perfect: tender and juicy on the inside, generously breaded, crispy, yet not greasy on the outside. Came with fried pickles which was quite a treat for me because...I've never had fried pickles before. I loved how crisp and refreshing they were, going well with the spicy sauce it came with. The beer cheese soup was thick, and had this bite to it from the beer. Exactly as I remembered, and beer cheese soup is actually my favorite soup besides lobster bisque. We enjoyed our dinner against the perfect backdrop of the beach and the sunset. They have live music here sometimes, so this place will always be the spot to go for an overall good time.  \n",

We began with a pitcher of sparkling sangria which was prepared table side. The gazpacho was excellent, with a choice of condiments. The paella was the epitome of perfection. We hope to become regular patrons!  \n",

Conveniently located on Magazine St., the lunch bento box is to die for and can easily be made vegan! (Ask for all veg tempura, seaweed salad instead of gyoza, and avo/cucumber rolls instead of California.) Hot sake there is great and we absolutely love the staff and ambience. I highly recommend Sake Cafe Uptown for vegans and non vegans! Best miso soup around!!  \n",

This is a very lively bar and the energy was palpable as we walked in. We were greeted rather quickly after being seated. The menu is somewhat limited but decent for a bar. I orginally wanted some mac n cheese with wings, but much to my dismay they stopped selling it. However, I settled for their cheesy bread as recommended by the server and the garlic parm wings. The cheesy bread was delicious and ate more like a mini pizza without sauce. The pita bread gave it a nice denseness that made it less heavy. The wings were juicy literally fall of the bone and had ample seasoning. I was even able to scoop up some of that seasoning with the cheese bread. I did have one drink Blue Balls that was vodka based which was smooth going down, but for me it was too bitter. Perhaps it was not the right drink for me as I normally really dont drink. I'll try something else next time. This is overall a fun place to be as they have alot of games to choose from as well as live music. Boyfriend had a great time here too and lived the wings (he has discerning taste in wings). Glad we found a great new spot for fun and eats!  \n",

Hodak's has some quality comfort food and my  server was super nice. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of my good overall experience.  \n",

The food is really tasty and the staff was really friendly. I went with a buddy while visiting Wash U, and we found out about the place through the \"GiftAMeal\" App: which let me donate two free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pick of my food through the app; I thought that was really neat! I'll be back when I'm in town.  \n",

Came here tonight with my wife and Kids  They loved it. This place has great atmosphere with music playing and people just having fun. And they have a roaming magician that does magic tricks at your table. Plus the service is excellent. The first thing you need to order is the soufflé for dessert. It takes a long time to make so you have to order it with your entree. We had jambalaya, gumbo, popcorn shrimp as well as the pasta kids dish. All were great.  My kids loved the soufflé.  \n",

Came out here craving sushi and remembered why i loved it. The place is clean and dimly lit for a relaxed vibe with oriental decor. I greeted and seated immediately upon arrival. My waiter was very kind and attentive, constantly checking if I needed anything. I was kinda in a hurry, so I was grateful when everything came out relatively quickly. The first thing I got was the sunomo salad (cucumber salad with daikon). It came with krab stick, shrimp, and octopus tentacle, which was quite a surprise because I didnt expect it, and I've never had this salad with octopus before. Nevertheless, it all tasted fresh and light, refreshing my palate in preparation for my two rolls. Again, it's been YEARS since I've had sushi so i wasnt quite sure what roles I wanted. I kept it plan and simple, opting for the Spider Roll and Mexican, perfect, never fail go-to's. These roles were HUGE, and for a moment i was nervous i wouldn't finish,  ut i made it through. They tasted great, without the sour, fishy, vinegary taste you would get with bad sushi, keeping their shape and form well from start to finish as they were expertly crafted. The sushi here is also comparatively cheap in comparison to other places on top of being of being large, so I definitely got my money's worth.  \n",

What exactly am I talking about?? Their shrimp and grits of course!! Some of their apps that I've had may come and go, but my shrimp and grits are here to stay!! (Or so I hope). What makes it so special is how all the ingredients work so well together: the giant shrimp, the andouille sausage (for a little smoky sweetness) and that tomato gravy all sitting on top of thick succulent cheddar grits with the thick, heavy curd! It might even be safe to say theirs is the best! (At least better than the shrimp and grits I've had at other places). Do yourself a favor, and if you visit this place not knowing what to get, try this dish!  \n",

Our only regret is the passage of time. The food was really great. My partner had the blue crab spaghetti and devoured it. I had the mac and cheese with pork and it was foodie nirvana for me. Plus I have leftovers! YAY!  \n",

I've been here before for their delicious shrimp and grits and loved it so much that I needed to get it again! I went with two other companions for this visit. One of my dinner mates was from Maryland and was not sure if she wanted to get blue crab spaghetti because she wasn't sure if she'd like it. I got the crab fritters and let her try some of it, and she enjoyed it and got the spaghetti, which she loved. My crab fritters are basically ooey gooey cheesy crab dip breaded and deep fried to golf ball sized lumps of heaven. It came with some mayo to dip, which I did not care for and left it out, but I did spread it on some of the house made saltine that came with my friend's kale dip. The shrimp and grits which I had for dinner, was of course, my reason for coming. What's not to love about this dish? I had a generous amount of lightly breaded shrimp  Andouille sausage lovingly smothered in Cajun spiced gravy. All of it was on top of their cheesy grits. Just as delicious as I remembered.  \n",

The food is also outstanding! I had a lump crab crabcake that was on a bed of caramelized onions and fresh arugula on top and spicy mayo. Next course was a lobster cavatelli pasta made with saffron cream and peas. I love how the pasta portion was not too large and perfectly al dente. I finished off this wonderful meal with a small cheesecake with lemon zest. Perfectly creamy and fresh Food here is top notch. Its pricey, but I feel that its well worth it.  \n",

That being said, I've developed some favorites. First off, I love their crab cake. Its all lump crab cake (as if I ever get crab cake that is not all lump meat) and its accented with a creamy sauce, pea shots and red peppers for a bit of a kick. I've also had the saffron cavatelli pasta with lobster meat which has a nice light, unique taste to it. Finally, I make sure I save ample room for dessert (because let's face it, dinner is really a prelude to dessert if you're as passionate about them as me). I adore their coconut cheesecake with fresh raspberries, mint, and passion fruit puree. It's relatively small, so its not overwhelming, but its heavenly and just big enough to satisfy.  \n",

I have eaten at restaurants around the world and never seen abalone eggs benedict until I stopped and paused while walking back from the main walk in Carpinteria, California. Sly's is unique. Tourists have to try the dishes at Sly's. The atmosphere was gorgeous with wood bars, wine bottles and large windows down the path from the ocean side park. Sly's restaurant is one of the reasons you need to stay at least one night in Carpinteria while on vacation in California. I would return to Carpinteria just to share the experience of dining at Sly's with my family, especially after walking along the shore.  \n",

Go see a movie if you want to talk to the stage.  \n",

The restaurant has some quality breakfast food, which really hit the spot. My server was really nice too, and my outdoor seating was a nice touch. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience.  \n",

One thing I love about Italian food is the versatility and the large variety: so many combinations of food available. I haven't been to Brio's for quite a few years, so I thought I was overdue for a visit, and my last visit here wss great. I love pasta ala vodka, and they have their pasta with little satchels filled with ricotta and pancetta, so I went for that. My server asked about adding lobster meat, and loving lobster as much as I do, how can I resist,so I went ahead and went with his suggestion. The entire meal was delicious with the combination of the vodka sauce, ricotta, and lobster mixed in with the pancetta. Pasta was cooked to perfection as well so I was able to enjoy to fully enjoy all the different flavors and textures that come with the meal. Best of all the portion wasn't guargantuan,which sometimes can happen with Italian food, so it was enough that I could handle. It's nice being able to eat out at restaurants again, and I've always remembered how beautiful this restaurant is in the middle of the Baystreet Plaza at the International Mall area. Lovely sleek interior decor that gives an Old World Italian feel. I chose to enjoy the nice weather we had outside, and their patio was relatively comfortable and had enough shading from the outside elements. I do plan on coming back, more than likely for the same dish, but I would like to add the lobster bisque with it. Probably a dessert too while I'm at it. Customer service was great, especially considering the challenges faced in the height of the pandemic. I was seated right away even though the hostess was pretty busy handling phone calls, so that too was a plus.  \n",

The French bread is crispy and so delicious and all the veggies (carrots cucumber jalapeño cilantro onion) were fresh as can be! The all veggie banh mi is only $4.25 so I went ahead and got two!!! Ate one pretty much immediately and will save the other to add tempeh or tofu to when I get hungry again.  5/5 highly recommended you try a banh mi from Mr. Bubbles! It's located inside the lobby entrance to Hong Kong Market.  \n",

I was here last night and had the Soba noodles. They were sooooo good I had to come back today for more!  I decided to try the Crab Rangoon, potstickers and spring rolls as well. All were perfect. The mango and coconut rice is the perfect finish.  \n",

A bit pricey but it's worth the extra $. They got an interesting coleslaw but it's actually quite good as well. Plenty of parking in the back if the front and side road is packed. They're pretty good on services too.  \n",

I selected this place me and my boyfriend's pre Valentine's Day dinner (we celebrate on the weekend before V-day) since they had food items that both me and my boyfriend would be excited about (he's always a surf and turf kind of guy and drinks!). So glad about my choice. Nestled away in a plaza in Oldsmar, this was actually out of the way of the heavy traffic and the usual hot spot of restaurants everyone goes to. Nevertheless, the house was packed. Our waiter was very nice and laid back and took time to listen to our questions and requests. I started off with a mojito that was light and refreshing. I'm not normally a drinker, but I was really feeling it by the time I had finished it. Our apps came out shortly. I started off the with fire shrimp, Rob had the scallops and polenta. What I loved about their fire shrimp is that it was more like tempura style you would get at a sushi place and drizzled with a creamy sriracha sauce. The result was light crispy shrimp that had the spicy kick from the sriracha. I had the BLT wedge salad next. It was rather small with the right ratio of bacon, tomato, and blue cheese so I had a little bit at each bite. Finally, my special order mac and cheese arrived with my addition of truffle oil and crab meat. Wow, did they blow it out of the water! It was like my usual lobster mac and cheese, but with crab and truffle sauce. I can tell they mean business with this mac and cheese. It came out in a cast iron skillet, and was actually larger than I thought it would be (isn't this supposed to be an app??) One of the best mac and cheeses I've had in my life! I made a good call with the truffle oil and the flavor was well infused throughout the whole dish. They used a generous amount of actual lump crab meat which gave it a different spin on the usual seafood mac and cheese I get. It was finished off with panko crumbs and more cheese which gave it a lovely crust on top. I had to take one spoonful of it to eat there at the restaurant before bagging the rest at home as I was already full. However, I wanted to make sure I got some dessert, so I ordered their crème brulee to go. The result was a blobby mess in the Styrofoam container, but they still tried to dress it up pretty with whip cream on the side with a mint leaf and some berries. I had it much later when I was at home and it was light and creamy with a slight note of vanilla and caramelized sugar. This place is definitely an Oldsmar gem that is one of the best reasons to come out here!  \n",

Their Flame Shrimp had the right amount of heat and crisp to keep you enticed until the last bite. My boyfriend was so impressed, he got the same thing for his birthday in addition for his entrée. Also, get the skillet mac and cheese. You can get it with bacon, crab, truffle oil, or just plain. However you would enjoy it best, you can't go wrong!  \n",

It's not that many restaurants I know of that offer both healthy, yet tasty menu items alongside my favorite indulge comfort foods, but this place managed to accomplish both! Being a hard core lover of pizza and usually turning to wraps and sandwiches for healthy eating, I'm probably somewhat biased in my review. However, what's not to love? Their sandwiches are top notch. For one, they're more like sandwich imposters that is really pizza, as the bread they use for the sandwiches are more or less the pizza dough. (And in my case, that is a good thing and a compliment). I've had their portabella sandwich that was crafted expertly with fresh mozzarella and peppers all snug between two pieces of bread (or pizza crust, whatever). I really love how they pair their sandwiches with a simple, yet elegant arugula salad instead of the usual side of fries or chips which would undo the health benefits of the sandwich and pack on more calories. Being so won over by their healthy food, I decided to visit for their pizza and wings. I had their white pizza and paired this with their stuffed mushrooms. I can greatly appreciate how their personal pizza was more like a flat bread and not greasy so it wasn't overwhelming to eat. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious and had a generous dollop of goat cheese. On another visit I then had their pesto loco flat bread and had their garlic parmesan wings. The wings were large and had a lot of flavor to them. I had sauce to go with it, but I didn't use. The pesto loco flat bread I would liken to more like a white personal pizza.

Our last visit the server (Jenn) was very helpful and knowledgable of the menu.  Gave us a few of her favorites and we both went with two of them.  Never skipped a beat and we had everything that made our visit awesome.\\nIf you're ever on this side of town, you must stop in, check out inside this cool building and taste the greatness of food.  \n",

Can't ask for more than that! The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience. I hope to return soon.  \n",

The serve quality meats and cheeses here and arrange it in a beautifully on the cheeseboard it is served on. I feel that the portions I'm given are good sizeable chunks versus just slivers of what looks like lunch meat and sliced cheese. They're also very flexible in what you can pick. I always go with the pick three (I might pick five if I'm really hungry or have company with me) cheeses. The wait staff are friendly and are able to help guide me of what cheese to get depending on what kind of flavor am I going for. I recall this one hard cheese that had a strong truffle taste to it and then another cheese that spread like butter. All their crackers and breads make for a wonderful pairing to put the cheese on if its a spreadable kind. If I get a meat, I make myself mini sammiches with the breads, meats and cheese. They have spiced almonds, dried fruits, fruit strips, as well as honey, gherkins, and mustards to compliment your assortment. They offer small plates such as salads and small pasta dishes if you have a bigger appetite. The restaurant itself is a gorgeous sleek place to relax to eat whether you're having your meal there or filling up on meats and cheeses as late night snacking after drinking.  \n",

Personally, I've had quite a few dishes here that have come and gone with the seasons, but they are always good. What I can always rely on though is that their charcuterie board is UNMATCHABLE in quality. I've had charcuterie in quite a few a places and theirs is the best. They have a wide ranges of cheeses and the menu describes from what animal and describes the texture. Meat selection is pretty vast too, but I find myself often going with just cheeses. It's all beautifully cut up and displayed on a wooden board and they have a wide variety of accompaniments such as spiced almonds, local honey, artisan jams, crackers, olives, gherkin, and bread slices.I like to pick 3 cheese/meats and pair that up with another dish (being that I have the appetite). I try to save an appetite for their pasta dish, because they have some of the THE freshest tasting pasta I've ever had and have a unique flavor. This they've opened, this has been one of my favorite places in St. Pete.  \n",

My pasta was amazing and my server was so friendly.

The ambiance was nice (there is a nice patio area), the service is awesome, and the food was excellent/authentic. I had the fajitas, which was a great choice! All of the food tasted really quality, from the awesome salsa to the tender/perfectly-cooked meat. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience.  \n",

They were so nice to give us the bigger pie. We felt like little piggies walking home with the jumbo box. Oink oink!  \n",

I like that they are directly across the street from me so I can head over for the pancakes in the fall! You can get them either full size (which i dont recommend unless you have a HUGE appetite) or the smaller version (which is what i get). In addition to these always tender pancakes having the perfect balance of pumpkin spice and flavor is the deliciously rich caramel pecan sauce that comes with it (i always ask for extra because i like my pancakes drowning in sauce or syrup). Sometimes it cones with whipped cream, sometimes it doesn't, either way is fine, I guess it depends on who's cooking. I enjoy a generous portion of always crispy bacon to balance out the heady sweetness of the pancakes. Definitely a place i look forward to coming to during the fall/winter season!  \n",

I frequent DTSP, so finding a good pizza place was always on my mind, but none them ever piqued my interest since they were generic fast food pizza joints. What set this place apart from the rest was the extensive variety of pizzas they do in non-conventional combinations (carbonara pizza?? roast beef with blue cheese???!! Okay, now they got my attention!) Most importantly, they have white pizza, which I haven't seen in any of the other pizzerias' menus. Although the variety drew me in there, it was also somewhat overwhelming. What to choose?? I went ahead and got their white pizza, since its my favorite. The thing about white pizza also is that nobody makes it the same. I enjoyed their rendition of it. Normally the white pizzas I've seen don't have meat, just spinach and sometimes tomato and mushroom. Theirs had Italian sausage, but I didn't mind that so I had it as is. I had the pleasure of eating it hot off the oven. The crust was thick, crisp on the outside, but chewy and tender on the inside. It was rather heavy laden with the ricotta, goat cheese, and sauce, but held together well as I tore the slices from the pie. I loved how the sharpness of the goat cheese balanced out the mild creaminess of the ricotta. It had a generous portion of vegetables so I felt less guilty for not getting salad today. They were fresh and added bright color: spinach, onions, and peppers, which went well with the Italian sausage. I ordered a personal pizza, which had four slices and was deceptively small as it took me an hour to eat the whole thing!. Luckily I came hungry so I didn't leave overfull. The personal pizza special came with chips and a drink which for $10 was a great deal, but you need to come before 4pm. They're next to Cupcakes Spot, so I highly recommend getting a cupcake to go AFTER having the pizza! Definitely planning another visit here, just not sure of what to get next!  \n",

Beautiful decor, warm and inviting, great atmosphere with great music playing, not too loud. The food is excellent. We had the combo fajitas with steak, shrimp and carnitas, plenty for three hungry people. The freshly made tortilla chips come with a delicious homemade salsa and yummy beans.

Good quick meal on the go that you can pair with a small side salad to square it off. Every time I eat here, my food is hot and fresh. I rip the empanada open with my hands (I like to be clean when I'm eating) and I can see how well stuffed it is with their tasty meats and filing. I've so far had the pleasure of having their crab meat (which by the way as real crab, and bits of shell, which can happen with crabmeat) and the beef and cheese (probably my favorite). Surprisingly, even though an empanada should have a generous amount of filing, my favorite part of them is actually the shell. I love how crispy it is on the outside, but soft and flaky on the inside. They're a relatively decent size; they look small but one will fill you up if you're trying to watch your portion. I did enjoy the salad as well even though it is basically just lettuce and olives. What makes it for me is the dressing with parmesan cheese, so if you're a cheese fan you'll enjoy this. Their café con leche is very good too; rich, creamy, and good body so I feel satisfied at the end of my meal. The store if very small, very clean. There's only two workers there, but its never crowded and you get your food quickly. Good spot to go to for a no fuss meal! I live in the area so I enjoy walking over there. After a while, I get tired of driving half an hour for a good place to eat, so this is a good break!  \n",

Even better is that you can easily create a very tasty and filling meal. For me personally, when I come I get one empanada, one small Italian salad (ALWAYS tossed) and a small soup (I've had both Spanish bean and black bean, and you can't go wrong with either). I recently tried their deviled crab and it was huge and nicely stuffed with crab. I had the black bean soup (delicious) to go with that and a salad. The food is made relatively quickly, however the quality is NOT fast food. I always get a small café con leche (very good and does NOT need any sweetener). This is a great place to go for a hearty, yet quick meal.  \n",

Just tried this place for the first time.  I was told about it by international students from China.  The prices are about right for the amount of food you get.  I was told that it is the only true Chinese restaurant in Isla Vista.  \n",

They really did a good job adding lots of trees and plants to the patio to give it a real tropical feel.  Plus they had a steel drummer the night that we were there.  The best dish we tried was the curry goat.  My kids loved it.  I've seen it on so many food shows but this is the first time I've seen it on a menu.  My son had the steamed muscles and clams appetizer and we also tried the Doro Wat chicken as well as the Jerk Chicken.  All were good.  But it was the curry goat that took the prize.   We will be back.  \n",

Whatever- anyway.\\n\\nI decided to peek at their Facebook page, Yelp! & all those spots, read the menu and took a dive.\\n\\nIt's a cute little place, 8-ish booths inside, a 4 stool counter top and two side counters for wheeler chairs to pull in.  Cute painting on the wall, and the decoy is filling.   There is also a cute little outside patio to sit at.... weather permitted.\\n\\nComing from the south, you'll have to U-turn on Kolb go get there.  Decent size parking lot.  Cute outside decoy.\\n\\nBATHROOM: There IS A SIGN that says 'No Public Restroom' but they are showing you to the restroom (JUST LIKE THE LAST RESTAURANT THAT WAS THERE) if need be.\\nThe sign may be there for NON-CUSTOMERS.\\n\\nI've been there a few times now, might become a regular spot for us, might already has.\\n\\nI've had a few different items.\\nChorizo Skillet Pie\\nPancakes & French Toast\\nBiscuits & Gravy\\nEggs over medium & scrambled- \\nI love that they pan fry their eggs.\\nBacon, Sausage \\nALL very tasty and good.\\nI was a bit thrown back by the hollandaise sauce on the B&G but that's my bad for not FULLY READING THE MENU.   \\nIt was still good, just different...\\n\\nBut that's THE POINT... the place is DIFFERENT.\\nNot your average breakfast foods, so your taste buds will be really having a blast here.  \\nThey DO have a normal $5 breakfast plate; meat, eggs, potatoes, toast.\\n\\nIt's a pay at the table place & there is a tip jar for the cooks- go ahead, slip a buck or two in there, they work hard too.  \\n\\nPlace is still pretty new, they may have a kink or two, although I didn't notice!\\n\\nGo check it out, it's good food & the folks are SUPER AWESOME!  \n",

The Pad Thai here is very authentic.  It is exactly how it is prepared in Thailand without using ketchup which would give it a red coloring which you will find with many westernized versions of the dish.  The Northern Thai Curry is another dish that they do really well and is probably my favorite.  I like to come to this restaurant for the food but also for the atmosphere.  It is always packed and sitting around the kitchen at the counter gives you a great vantage point to see the chefs at work.  The only downside is that it is always packed with people.  I recently learned that if the counter is full you can just get takeout and sit at one of the communal seats in the marketplace.  It isn't as fun as the counter but it could be a bit faster.  \n",

So had to try!  Great service-got seated immediately on a Sunday morning before 9am.  Noticed people waiting to be seated starting around 9...just started snowing so it was pretty watching outside from our table. Jenny was immediately attentive and ready with coffee!  Food was generous portions in a stainless steel 12\" skillet! I tired my best to eat my meal and my husband cleaned his skillet clean! Thank you, Yelp, for helping us to find a great breakfast place after watching our San Diego State basketball team win last night!  The trip from San Diego was so worth it!  \n",

Unique texture and taste of the crust is addictive. Topping combinations are also fresh and imaginative while not being weird. Funny and smart experts behind the counter and everyone that I talked to in line were as as excited as I. Keep it up y'all.  \n",

              "2604750                                                                                                                                            On the flight in, already so ravenous that travelers in close proximity were hitting call buttons, worried about that growling sound coming from 29B, tired of reading what I brought and in complete short-attention span mode I pulled The Magazine from the seat pocket and wondered if I'd ever do that dollar bill origami towards the end after the featured spots on this and that and the plastic surgery ads and what not there was a short one-page piece on a New Orleans eatery recently opened.  Rabbit liked the James Beard award and I was all taken a bit with the novelty of Mediterranean fare having been thinking only of Creole for about the last three months straight.\\n\\nI did mental tricks to remember to bookmark after deplaning as the WiFi was broken and I'd have considered paying the 8 clams just for this but it was broken so I had to make a little Shaya song in my head.  It seemed significant.\\n\\nOn Saturday after Commander's Palace the evening before and the other almost obligatory stops hither and yon it was raining and off we went on the St. Charles streetcar through and past the Garden District to a part of the fine city where I had not yet been.  For a moment that morning I was all it's raining and maybe some more Creole local goodness maybe at K-Paul's right down the street or maybe drinks all day at the Carousel Bar but no there was a bookmark and duty called.  The streetcar is a must-ride anyway and it wasn't raining that hard and the hotel gave us an umbrella and I was pretty much out of excuses at that point.\\n\\nSo let me tell you.  This is the only review I'm going to write for this last trip to New Orleans.  Because Shaya pretty much put everything else on the everything else list.  Its location on Magazine out by Napolean forces the visitor from the Quarter discomfort zone in such a way that also makes convenient a lovely streetcar ride then a lovely stroll back to the madness with perambulation through Garden and right past the cemetery that if the timing is right you can poke into and play Rainy Day Woman in your head.\\n\\nMake a reservation unless you're all about rolling dice and sadness at the outcome.  I'm thinking that we were blessed by the rain, for as we had no spot reserved thinking it's the middle of a Saturday afternoon who needs to be all hemmed in by promises.  You need to be, trust, as but for the inclemency we might not have even snagged those two seats at the bar after a little wait because it was full.  Not a reservation to be had and the tables turned with maybe a little breather so staff could make them perfect and welcoming for the next lucky contestants.\\n\\nFeast.\\n\\nThere are little accompaniment plates of pickled and roasted things and small salads three for 15 and I think 5 for 25 (por nous Brussels sprouts and pickled things and a little tabbouleh), different ways for hummus (butternut squash), lamb kabobs without sticks that were so good on a rainy day and a shakshoukah in a pan which is also for the rain and I am as serious as I am sitting here right now - everything was so perfect.  The bar seating is sometimes a preference for me if the chairs have backs for you know who and they did.  In the right place such an arrangement allows for more frequent interaction with a person that knows stuff if there is one and Saturday the fellow that helped us with our happiness knew so much.\\n\\nA couple of miles strolling through sidewalks that in California would be lawsuits and gas lamps all over then a quick cemetery and back in the Quarter we were exercised and ready for round whatever of whatever it wasn't going to be Shaya.\\n\\nIf you live in New Orleans you have the luxury of time, so go maybe on a special night.  If you're planning a visit, plan ahead.  Make bookmarks and reserve early.  Trust.  You need to go here.  \n",

The burger is amazing and is very fairly priced. The bacon chips and shashito peppers are to die for.  \n",

The food there was fresh. I had the duck breast with side salad. The meat on the breast was tender and flavorful from the orange marmalade. Side salad was rather generous portion and had variety of ingredients. I don't really like rice much, but the rice that came on the side was okay. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Eager to come back here.  \n",

I selected the crab mac and cheese, lobster cake, and alligator hush puppies. As soon as the food came out, I knew right away I made the right choice. Getting apps are a great way of getting a sample of some food without the major commitment, but not leaving something to be desired. I've had my fair share of seafood mac and cheese and each place makes it differently. What gives this dish its unique flavor hefty amount of crab meat on top of it and the lager beer sauce, which I could really taste. I love crab cakes, but I really loved this lump lobster cake that came with a thick spicy sauce. Their alligator hush puppies were wonderfully moist and flavorful on the inside and crisp on the outside. The guava pie was a perfect finale for the evening. It was very light and not at all too sweet with a shortbread crust. Service was outstanding like it was last time I came out here and let myself and my friend relax and enjoy our food instead of rush us despite it being crazy busy as usual.  \n",

Our server was really nice and helpful, despite the late hour, and we made sure to leave a big tip. Our pizza hit the spot and our sides (although pretty standard) were tasty comfort foods. The restaurant also uses this phone app called GiftAMeal, which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat. I will definitely keep this place in mind the next time I'm out with some friends!  \n",

I'm going to get fired if I keep this up.\\n\\nI can't help it.  Philly was so much fun.\\n\\nA highlight was this place.  Have you ever been to the Grand Central Market in LA?  This is that times four.  Though the Grand Central is down the block from 500 Days of Summer and the store where OJ got his knife, still,  I think I like the Reading Terminal Market better.  And for a multiple bypass on a roll?  DiNic's.\\n\\nI slipped from my engagement early and arrived before noon.  There were a thousand places from which to choose in the Market, all the stalls, all the vendors under the sun.  I used my gastro ouija board, I spun the wheel.  I grabbed the last stool at the counter and begged me an Italian Pork with peppers.\\n\\nUtters expletive.\\n\\nSeriously, as I sit here sending this to you I'm faint with the hunger, wanting to eat the memory.  This place is simply amazing.  I would, no foolin, fly back to Philly just to hit the market a second time.  To tempt the fates, to shorten my wingspan.  I do not care.  My days are numbered.  I'm going to fill each minute of each day with as many stars as I possibly can.\\n\\nThe stumble on DiNic's was pure luck, simple serendipity.  I owe the goddess a debt of gratitude.  \n",

Have been coming here since I moved here almost 10 years ago. They always treat you like you are the only table they have for the night. Ali is by far the most professional 'Capitan' and is always exceptional. The head maître d' Michael is also great. \\n\\nLove the Cesar Salad made table-side! Love the lobster bisque! Love the filet mignon! Love the Cafe Diablo!\\n\\nHarrah's Steak House would get 10 stars if I could give them more than 5 :)  \n",

Our waiter at Chiba made the whole experience so great!!! I went with my fam (5 vegans and 2 non vegans), my mom had a LOT of questions  and our waiter took them all with ease and grace and he helped us order up a vegan storm of amazing fresh sushi!!! The sushi was GREAT. I wish I could remember his name, but our waiter also let us know that the kitchen could make us a vegan noodle dish and when they accidentally used butter instead of EVOO he caught it well before it came out, had them make it again, and then served us both of the dishes (the non vegans could eat the one w butter and is vegans got the cruelty free version and we trusted him because he was really looking out for us!). I highly reconnect Chiba for oak st sushi. Restaurant was clean and quiet/peaceful, great place for groups or a date!  \n",

(You can usually sit at the counter much faster)  The employees are friendly, the cooks are amazing and the staff keeps your water and/or coffee always filled.\\nI am absolutely in love with the Huevos Rancheros and have really stopped trying anything else there.  They have outrageous sized pancakes, one can probably be shared at the table as a snack.  The home-fries are delicious and you'll always see a pile cooking on the grill.\\nJust visiting town?  You must check this place out at least once!  If you live here in Tucson, what the hell you waiting for?!?!  \n",

We flew in from Seattle and came straight to this restaurant. We enjoyed 3 dinner rolls a piece. Every bite of every role is absolutely delicious. The sushi chef was wonderful and the waiters were very courteous and friendly . We will definitely be back  \n",

I have never been here before, but it has been on my bucket list for the longest time since its first opened for many reasons. Looking over the menu, it has alot of southern faves (fried chicken) with a chic twist (those bowls that have lately been all the rage) so i knew it would have alot to offer any taste. Sooo....today was a cheat day...meaning no bars hold on what I could get to indulge in...but despite of that, i couldn't take my eyes away from their #1 salad with ahi tuna. First off, on my cheat day, i dont do salads, second, unless its Panera, i really dont do salads...period. However, i REALLY love ahi, and the description sounded so fresh and tantalizing, that i just couldnt resist the urge to try it. So i went for it. I had the grilled artichokes as my app, because again, it's not sonething i see often on a menu. Of course, i eas eyeballing the keylime pie before i even got my app ordered. The artichokes were delicious with a nice crisp to them. I really enjoyed digging into the hearts and dipping it into the sauce. When my salad, i was pleased for two reasons, 1) it wasnt a voluminous mass of lettuce with some toppings sprinkled on as dinner salads tend to be and 2) it was nicely plated, a small mound of the salad that had avocado, carrot, and lightly dressed with mango. Of course, i dove into the ahi first. Fresh and delicate in taste, i will never go back to canned. The salad itself had a nice light flavor to it, which was refreshing too from the mango. I took my keylime pie home to go and ravished it immediately upon arriving. It had this nice tart creamy flavor which was balanced by the whipped cream. I normally dont finish the crust, but their crust was airy in texture and went great with the rest of the whipped cream.  \n",

I am probably one of their most frequent visitors but Im sure there are plenty of people who feel the same! I love the tacos in all flavors and have them at least once a week. \\nIf your looking for the real thing then I highly recommend you give them a try.  \n",

I came here with a friend for our monthly dinner outing. Word of advice for anyone who arrives past 5 pm on a Saturday night; make sure you have a reservation. The place was packed with people waiting for a table and we were seated rather quickly at a nice, clean booth. Our waitress attended to us right away to get our drinks. I knew what I wanted right away; crispy buffalo shrimp and for my entrée, the lobster mac n cheese. The only thing was I was very torn between getting the appetizer mac and cheese and getting the full entrée. My friend convinced me to get the entrée, so I got that. Our apps came out first: she had the crab cakes (her favorite), and of course there was my buffalo shrimp. I had to try some of hers: all lump crab meat atop some corn and tomato. The seasoning they put in it gave the crab cake a lovely kick. I think my buffalo shrimp was better though; it had the right breading to meat ratio, crispy on the inside and kept its form on the shrimp as I slathered it with the chunky bleu cheese. Each shrimp was also lovingly coated with their not too spicy buffalo sauce. The shrimp sat on a bed of shredded lettuce, which I used as a small salad with the remainder of the buffalo sauce and the bleu cheese (and there was a generous amount left). Then my entrée came: seeing the size of it, I instantly wished I got the appetizer portion instead. However, I was determined to eat only half and bring the rest home to my boyfriend (who luckily agreed to eat some when I brought it back) and me to share. It came with asparagus on the side. I eat quite a bit of lobster mac and cheese, and I feel that I've had it from many places enough to say with authority that no two lobster mac n cheese dishes are the same. This one happens to be rated per them to be \"the best lobster mac n cheese\" in the Tampa Bay area. I do feel that the title is well deserved. This special dish consists of spiral pasta covered with cheddar cheese sauce, some scallions for accenting flavor, bread crumbs on top (not usually a fan of bread crumbs though for mac n cheese) and notably large clumps of lobster meat. I enjoyed every last bit of my half of the dish. My friend had salmon, and although hers was a bit too dry for my taste, she stated that this salmon was some of the best she's had. Our meals were also somewhat modestly priced for what we got. My buffalo shrimp with lobster mac and cheese was only some thirty dirty dollars. My boyfriend was happy with the mac n cheese too that I brought home and we shared. This is definitely one of my top picks for seafood in the area.  \n",

Anything and everything I have ever tried has been really good and the service has always been good. Usually there is a small wait time but it is defiantly worth the 15 or 20 minute wait  \n",

I really dig the place.\\nSmall joint, maybe 15 tables/booths total with about 10 seats at the counter.  I didn't actually count but I'm sure I'm close.\\n\\nWe got in right away, directed to sit anywhere we want.  Our server was very pleasant and cheerful. \\nFor sure ask for Brenda!   \\n\\nFood arrived, presentable and delicious.  Homemade bread; yum!   Prices are reasonable and basic.

I was so impressed with what I sampled at a previous Elite Event, that I knew my boyfriend and friends would be too. I started off with their strawberry basil tea, which was a perfect balance of earthy and sweet. For my dinner I had their pasta carbonara with penne pasta instead of spaghetti (per the waiters suggestion) and Voodoo Shrimp and Thai Chili Shrimp for appetizer (no pic of the Thai shrimp--boyfriend got greedy and at it all as soon as it was brought out). The entire dinner was outstanding. The sauce on the voodoo shrimp was so thick and flavorful that everyone was sopping it up with the warm breadsticks brought out. I'm huge on pasta dishes, and I think their pasta carbonara is the best I've tasted before. It wasn't too heavy as this dish could be, and had a rather generous portion of bacon and chicken on it. Even though the sauce lightly coated the dish, it still had a bold rich flavor. As great as all the food was, I think the crowning glory of the whole meal was the best dessert I've ever had (which is a huge superlative because I LOVE ALL kinds of desserts and have had a lot). Their chocolate decadence cake, which I first got acquainted with at the yelp event, is so rich yet had a mousse like texture. I really loved their coffee whipped cream that accompanied it. I would go to Grillsmith JUST for that dessert. I would definitely get the exact same dinner on my next visit, except maybe keep spaghetti for the pasta.  \n",

This is one of the nicest and most fun bars I have ever visited.  The hospitality was off the charts fantastic as well.  If you are looking for a private event space in Nashville , look at this venue!! It's fantastic.  Best rooftop in the city, overlooking the stadium and the river.  Mae will treat you right !!  \n",

Just happened upon this gem on the way home from Fernley and I'm so happy we decided to try it! Delicious Butter Chicken with yummy rice pilaf and hot, buttery naan. The service is excellent and the portions are generous. I can highly recommend Cafe Masala!!  \n",

They were both superb. My servers have been friendly and professional each time I come here. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" that let me donate 2 free meals (each time!) just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience! I will definitely be back!  \n",

We chose the supreme and were very satisfied with our selection. The toppings were generously piled on and the crust was able to handle the heavy load. So happy to experience this venue.  \n",

You can find Vege-licious in a little back entrance of a little house in Mid-Town / Watkins Park in Nashville. There's a small parking lot after you follow signs to the entrance. The restaurant is a sweet tiny clean spot with about 6 tables. The decor is cute and fresh and the service is unbeatable. Bettina and her team sure now how to make and serve some good comfort food!!!!!! I got the SoulChik Plate Hot with Mac & Cheese and greens and a roll. It was AMAZING; best Mac & cheese I've ever had (vegan or otherwise!)!!! My cousin got the V-licious burger (black bean based) and he LOVED IT. The pancakes and breakfast tacos looked and smelled amazing, I just wish I could have tried it all!!! I HIGHLY recommend Vege-licious for vegans and non vegans! 3 thumbs WAY up!!!!  \n",

First off, all the ingredients in their food is high quality. From the fresh crisp salads with a large variety of toppings, down to the dough they use for the pizza and croutons, Marco's gets it right. I usually go with one of two items: A personal Cheezy White pizza or their meatball bake with a side of cheezy bread and garden salad (that I split with my boyfriend). No other pizza place has the unique Cheezy White that Marco's has. Where do I begin what I love about it?? Well, for one, no red sauce, but it has fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and bacon. The flavor combo is incredible. The meatball bake with cheezy bread as the side is basically a deconstructed meatball pizza, but I'm okay with that.  I like to use the red sauce (I normally hate red sauce, but I love theirs because of the bold robust flavor, not watered down or sweet like some other sauces) to tip the thick buttery cheezy bread. Their salads are decent too if you want to try to be a little healthy. Their garden salad has a generous amount of black olives, green peppers, tomatoes, and onions, with cheddar cheese to complete it. My favorite stay-at-home and watch TV kinda meal.  \n",

If I'm more in the mood for sharing though, I would recommend getting the meatball bake with cheezy bread. They also make great subs if you don't feel like a drab and boring Subway sub.  \n",

We came in tonight for my wife's birthday.  Everything we tried was excellent.  I had the ribs, my wife had the fried chicken, and my kids had the mussels.  The portions were huge!  And the prices were good for such a nice restaurant.  We could barley finish all our food. Will definitely return.  \n",

We came in early on a saturday and my kids loved sitting at the counter.  We had a cheese, a peperoni, and a peperoni mushroom pizza.  All were awesome.  We loved it, our kids loved it, and it wasn't that expensive considering it was in montecito.  Our server Ryan wAs the best.   For a second I thought he was the owner since he went so far out of his way to make sure we were taken care of.  \n",

Didn't think it would look that..... nice?  What's the words I'm searching for.... fancy?   Cute?  Clean?  & seriously NOT THAT expensive!   \\n\\nWe stayed to eat.  Everyone was very nice & friendly & the manager/boss was greeting people as well.\\n\\nThere is a cute kids area on the back south side.

I had the sea bass and my husband had the filet and Mac N cheese. Another example where a GREAT restaurant that doesn't pay into the \"Yelp\" scheme gets penalized in their reviews. Thanks for the good music and good times.  \n",

Awesome flavor and spices that are different from your typical buffalo chicken flavoring. Fries were really good and their special dipping sauce was great too. The owner D was super nice.

The bartender was very friendly and gave us a generous pour on the wine.  It's a great space which is run by the same people from Crush Cakes.  Check it out.  \n",

When we moved to St Pete, we made it a priority to have our first special dinner here. It was incredibly delightful. This will be our go-to destination for every occasion!  \n",

Do you still have five hours of dark road to travel before you call yourself home?  But I didn't, because Mama raised me better.  Or at the least, Mama tried (her pleading I denied).\\n\\nBacktrack.  Learned the details of certain Socal cuisine on the way.  And thanks to the app before the battery drained arrived at this lovely establishment minutes before the late-evening crush.  Santa Barbara fancies itself Parisian, what with the supper at 9 o'clock and all.  It must be the balmy breezes.\\n\\nPork in an iron skillet with achiote peppers and sauce from Above, chicken falling off it's bone, nay, jumping, to swim more completely in its mole.  Fresh guacamole and fragile chips.  One Negro Modelo.\\n\\nTell you what, a thousand mile day, or almost, can take a toll.  Stars on the Gaviota Coast with the Christmas trees offshore kept company by a hand and the happiest belly for which a man could ever ask erases all that.  No question that the balance of the evening in a tent cabin at El Cap might have been the better icing on that cake, but absent that, I'm not complaining.\\n\\nRadius test - 418 miles.  Make the trip to Los Agaves.  Stay a while, if you can.  \n",

Hell, even if I'm coming back from LA, sometimes it's worth it to detour all the way out to Santa Barbara instead of the 5. Huge burritos and huge nachos. Not too many places to sit considering the traffic they have but who cares?  \n",

GRUB!  And for us, that part of our life is all about the greatness that is Freebirds ... and hell, who are we kidding, it's still all about Freebirds.  Because whether it's a high school don't-tell-the-parents-we're-going-to-UCSB run, a college heading-down-to-see-buddies run, or an I'm-driving-on-the-101-anywhere-near-Santa-Barbara run ... it's important to plan your adventure around Freebirds.  In a nutshell, it's a 24 hour Mexican joint serving up giant burritos, piled high nachos, and our personal favorite, stuffed-with-more-junk-than-a-junior-high-training-bra quesadillas.  As we eluded to it above, The Good Grub discovered this place back in the good ol' days of high school, driving up to Isla Vista for a little ... um ... higher education?  Well let's just say Freebirds' taught us more about life than any US History or Geometry teacher ever could ... and drunk food is delicious!  But without hesitation, this stuff is AMAZING ... any time of day, any hunger level, any blood alcohol level.  Ever been waiting in line, waiting to order, and realize that if you don't swallow soon, your mouth watering-with-anticipation will surely drown you before too long?  What? ... Never happened to you? ... Well, you've clearly never waited in line at Freebirds, eying down the massive assembly-line style of Mexican glory.  Pick your vessel (burrito, nachos, or, as we mentioned, our pick ... the quesadilla), then load it up with as much beans (black, pinto, or sticky-icky re-fried), rice, cheese, fresh salsas, lettuce, sour cream, onions (raw or deep-fried), cilantro, and a healthy thwap of guacamole ... if you know what you're doing.  And if you really want to look like a local, go for one of their hybrids.  Like a \"quesarito\"... basically a quesadilla with all it's melty cheesiness ... then opened up, filled up, and rolled into burrito glory.  Because why would you want to eat a burrito that doesn't have a metly layer of cheese in every bite?  And now you've got a little idea why I bounce with excitement when I get a chance to go back to this place ... and if you don't yet ... you will soon.  Because the Grub is coming, and Freebirds is bringing it strong!  \n",

I have been coming here for years and consistently get good food and service. I usually get the lobster mac and cheese, which I think is the best (sorry 400 Beach House) due to the combination of cheeses and amount of lump lobster meat. I've also had their Pasta Brava, which is their version of pasta carbonara, and this is good too. I get a side of the misticanza  salad (simple garden salad) and added gorgonzola cheese for an extra dollar. My sister swears by their brussel sprouts and this is the only thing she gets here. In her defense, its a big plate and the sprouts are pan seared with bacon, so I could see how this would be filing.  \n",

Plus the portion was so generous, I had the ultimate pleasure of a second serving the next day. We had the limoncello sampler for dessert and it was absolutely fabulous. We shall return!  \n",

What I usually like to get when I come here is one of their pasta dishes and I pair it with a small version of their misticanza salad (spring mix, tomatoes, onions, and greek olives all mixed in a light vinagrette). Its light and refreshing, but I always get gorgonzila cheese added for a little extra bite. When it comes to the pasta, I typically go with either lobster mac n cheese or the pasta brava. What I love about their lobster mac n cheese is that its lighter on the cheese sauce and you can taste the lobster in every bite. The truffled bread crumbs give it a nice touch. My other choice would be their pasta brava, which is more or less their version of pasta carbonara, but better.  \n",

Our server was really friendly and the ambiance was cozy. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food through the app; I think that's pretty neat! I will definitely eat here again when I'm around.  \n",

It was so worth the wait! It was extremely challenging to chose from all the tempting offerings. Luckily I truly believe I found the ultimate comfort food in my Korean BBQ melt. I devoured half and saved half for the next day. The team was super friendly and helpful! I plan to be a frequent flyer!  \n",

Of course, I'm talking about delicious, tasty grilled cheese. Grilled cheese is one of those essential comfort foods that everyone loves (mostly) and Central Melt offers up a rather large variation of the classic. The menu includes sandwiches with different types of cheeses, meats, and veggies as well as sauces. The first time I ever tried Central Melt was when they had their special Blueberry Basil melt. Not something I would try on my own since I typically don't like fruits in savory dishes (even though I'm coming around a little), but curiosity got the best of me. The sandwich incredible, but it was only offered that one time. I went ahead and tried a regular grilled cheese, since I never feel like you can go wrong with the classics. This, of course, is not your elementary school's grilled cheese. Everything about the sandwich was perfect: the crisp on the outside chewy on the inside thick cut of white bread, the melted generous portion of cheddar cheese that was present in every bite that even oozed outside the crust. I added some tomato for more texture and flavor. I'm not normally a fry kind of girl, but I do love their nacho cheese fries to go along with the sandwich. These fries were perfectly seasoned, crisp and smothered with white cheese on top of nacho cheese sauce so I could taste it with each bite. The people here are friendly too, which is always an added plus. Apparently they also make tomato soup and salad, which I haven't tried yet, but I might get around it if I don't get too full from what will be my usual when I come here.  \n",

It's small so try to go at less crowded times! It's conveniently located along magazine street and is a few good vegan options! The tofu scramble is great and the avo mash with a side of toast is a great meal! Coffee galore, they never leave your mug empty, always topping it off. Staff is so friendly and helpful. I've never had a bad experience at Surrey's Uptown!  \n",

I felt that this place nailed everything from presentation of food to customer service, so the reputation I've read about is very well deserved. We came here for dinner on the Saturday before Valentine's Day. For my appetizer I ordered the Fried Tomato salad. I love how lightly coated with breading the tomato was, almost like a tempura so it had a nice crunch as I bite into it. I ate the two tomatoes like tacos with the goat cheese on top. It came with a bright fresh mix of arugula salad for a nice light finish. Since I don't normally drink, the Fig Lebowski was a bit too strong for me, but I loved the sweet brown sugary taste of it. Then we ordered our main dish. Because I'm a fan of duck, I had to have the duck as my main. This particular dish is a cut above the other duck entrees I've had before. For one thing, it was very lean and yet it practically melted in my mouth as a chewed it. I put the yogurt sauce on top of it which enhanced the flavor. This dish came with more of the arugula and lentils. I'm definitely not a fan of rice, so I appreciated how they had the lentils as the grain to go with the meal. The portions are relatively small, but enough to fill up on, which was another plus for me (I hate when I get so full and overwhelmed with large quantities of food). The staff here was awesome and friendly to chat with. Even Chef Pierola herself stopped to chat with us and asked how everything was. Somehow we ended up with our desserts free. I was kind of full already so I just ordered the ice cream; one of the dishes they well known for. I had two scoops of the chicory coffee ice cream (I really love coffee, so this was a natural choice) and the brown butter flavor (out of curiosity and I've heard great things about this flavor). I thought I made a perfect choice with the pairing. The chicory coffee had a good bold taste of coffee , but then the subtle sweetness from the brown butter scoop balanced it out. The three scoops came out in a bed of brown sugar, which was a nice touch. Their menu changes frequently, but when I come back, I would love to get the same thing! Definitely worth an encore presentation!  \n",

We gave it pleeeeeeeeenty of time to get all the kinks out.  Or, it might be because we've heard it's crazy over priced for what you get so we were intimidated.\\n\\nWalk in, very welcoming.  Small place, can see why 'bigger' parties are asked to call in ahead of time.\\n\\nWe were sat right away.  One side has a bar, with some tables, other side has booths/tables and in the middle was like a counter space.  Didn't see anyone sit there, unsure if they use them.  Cool idea.\\n\\nWe were greeted fast and given little green chile corn bread muffins and butter.  I didn't like them, but I'm picky.  The man loved them.  I got the 6 oz sirloin, $17. The man got the ribeye $26.  We both picked the 'one trip' salad bar, which I got ALL EXCITED OVER, instead of the soup of the day.  We also both picked the grilled veggie of the day.\\nWe both enjoyed our meals and we didn't need to use any 'sauce' to eat!  \\nThe price (typical 'steak house' prices!

Grimaldi's makes thin crust New York style pizzas. Apparently they use New York water in order to create authentic tasting New York pizza dough. The results are delicious. I get a nice thin crust that's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I'm a sucker for white pizza, so I either choose their Quattro Formaggio or the Classic White with garlic. Both are different in that the latter is your usual white pizza while for the former as more bite to it from the gorgonzola cheese. My pizza that I got today was the Quattro Formaggio with ricotta cheese (an extra $2). The four cheeses melted together perfectly creating this creamy texture from the ricotta and the sharp flavor from the gorgonzola. I had the personal pizza with every intent to eat it all, but my twin, who is a picky eater, had two slices. Of course, my visit is never complete without their cheesecakes! They are some of the freshest, creamiest cheesecakes around and come in a variety of flavors depending on the season. Every January so far, they've carried my favorite of all time, their amaretto cheesecake made with amaretto cookie crust, amaretto New York cheesecake, toasted almonds and whipped cream. Creamy, not too sweet, with some fluffy texture as the fork rakes through the cake. I love the slightly browned top of the cheesecake filling. If I'm not in the mood for pizza, I'll always make sure I make a trip for these cheesecakes!  \n",

Best decision ever. The cocktail offerings were creative, causing a tough choice to be made. We both went with appetizers which were so generous and tasty that we got no further.  \n",

While in Nashville, I have been looking for great HOT chicken. Well Nudie's did not disappoint. It was a simple sandwich, but had great flavor. I enjoyed it. The music was feeling killer for a Saturday at noon show.  \n",

I sat on the patio for lunch and got the chicken and waffles (a buddy that I came with recommended it and it did not disappoint!). The food was great, my server was awesome, and I felt very satisfied with my experience. The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" which let me donate 2 free meals just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great experience overall.  \n",

Either was nice and easy. The menu were straight forward and tasted great. Got the tonkotsu and a bowl of poke. You got to choose the toppings and sauces as usual. \\n\\nThe ramen in my opinion definitely deserves a shout out. It tasted great, more on the mild side, and as I've always said - you can always add more sauces but you can't take it out haha, so they did a great job not making it over salty like others.  \n",

This is one of my favorite places to eat at when I'm in the Hyde Park Village. They have a rather unique mix of menu items such as quiche, pasta dishes, pizza, sandwiches, etc. For me personally, I love the pastas. I've had their carbonara which is very rich and generous on the bacon, but I think I really like their baked gnocchi better. It had a lot of cheese on it, and I felt the garnish gave it a pretty touch. I also had their Chesapeake Scallops that came with almost a soup like sauce (that I couldn't help but drink because it was so good) that had a bold brandy flavor to it.I would get this pairing again on my next visit.  \n",

The beets were amazing. We came in today for Mother's Day lunch.  The staff was very friendly and professional.  Our waitress was very informative. My kids loved the food. Everything we tried was good but the dish that stood out was the beets.  I've never ordered beets since they sound so boring.  Here however they were nicely spicy and delicious. The spicy chicken was also a favorite.  The Ethiopian lunch is only on Saturday and Sunday for lunch.  \n",

It has a nice, upscale vibe to it, and the staff is really friendly! They have a great drink selection and some refreshing bar food. The place also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\"  which let me donate 2 free meals to a food pantry just by snapping a pic of my food through the app! I thought that was really neat, on top of an overall great experience! I will be back!  \n",

The hamburgers are really good and if you can eat the double burger you wont go away hungry. Many locals eat here on a daily basis and the owner is probably one of the friendliest you will meet.

Why? Well, you get your meat, with an app (crab cake) and some asparagus for a vegetable all in one sitting! This meal is a perfect standalone dish that is second to no one!! The service here is incredible and they truly embody fine dining in a way I don't see much of (arranging your coat for you, helping you get seated). This time I got myself their fresh squeezed lemonade which really hit the spot after walking around the terrible heat for a few hours. The meal is rather pricey (it came up to $66, but I had an e-mail promotion which took off $25. I would have been willing to pay full price otherwise, but $25 is too good to pass up!) but the quality makes it worth it and if you're going to eat at a steak house, eat like you mean it!  \n",

I arrived early and they were willing to seat my boyfriend and I right away. It was perfect because we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. We have been here two times now and came here for my birthday because my boyfriend and I both agreed that they were great! They certainly live up to our image from last time! All the wait staff was very friendly and helpful. My boyfriend and I each had a filet mignon, Oscar style with some variation. My boyfriend stated that his dinner was the best filet mignon he's ever had. My dish was equally as wonderfull; tender meat topped by large amount of fresh crab meat and four grilled asparagus spears. I also had a lobster bisque soup. It had the perfect consistency, not too runny, and not too thick. There were bits of lobster meat in the soup and was flavored with a dash of different spices that gave it complex flavor. Of course, because I'm a dessert diva, I had to have my dessert. But first, they surprised me by sprinkling confetti on our table before I ordered my dessert. I had the chocolate espresso torte, which thankfully was very small because this taste little torte was dense and thick. It mixed two of my favorite flavors: chocolate and coffee! I followed up this filling dessert with the refreshing raspberry sorbet with the fresh berries and crème anglaise. The best surprise for me is that my dessert came with a candle and the words \"Happy Birthday\" were written in chocolate! I had forgotten my camera that day (I don't like using my phones to take that many pictures other than my food) so the waitress took our photo with my dessert before I finally ate it. I even got a card that the staff signed. Very sweet gesture, and wonderful food. Price is high, but to me the food I worth it! Best for going on a special occasion. Its located on the Sundial, so there's plenty to see and do out in the area.  \n",

What I love about it is that they offer many varieties of food, and they do it very well. Initially I was suspicious about a place that would offer Italian, American, and Japanese food in one menu. A place that's trying to be many things at once can't possibly be any good! Well, I was wrong. The first time I came out here was for New Year's Eve. My boyfriend and I first took notice of the wonderful smell of grilled meat and the cleanliness of the inside of the restaurant. I had the seafood fra diavlo alfredo style. This seafood alfredo was wonderfully seasoned seasoned: al dente fettucine pasta lightly coated with alfredo sauce, but it has a nice kick to it! The pasta even came with large portion of shrimp, scallops, and lobster tail. Serving was very generous of all the seafood, and each element of it were seasoned perfectly. I was so impressed, I came back to try to the sushi. All of it is always fresh and they have a large variety of sushi rolls to choose from. I typically go for the Screaming Delight (cooked) because I love spicy mayo and avocado. Service is always on point and attentive. This would be a good option for anyone if you are unsure of what to get when going out on a date or after work. (They serve alcohol, and bar fare too).  \n",

Sat in the back patio which is kind of a secret since you have to walk through the kitchen to get there.  The food was good and our kids especially liked the Mie Goreng noodles,  \n",

Plenty of selections on their menus and everything is cooked very well. Very good services from their staff and parking is good enough for where it is. Try their black raspberry wine.... as for food, nothing on there have disappointed me yet! Plenty of good free side dishes as well!!  5/5  \n",

My food was so delicious and authentic, and the staff was great! What more can you ask for? My buddy who is Mexican loves this place too, so I think that says something special about Chaparritos's quality and authenticity! The restaurant also uses this phone app called \"GiftAMeal,\" that let me donate 2 free meals just by snapping a pic of my food via the app. I thought that was really neat, on top of a great dining experience!  \n",

Almost too extensive of a menu, with any and every kind of food possible, cocktails, beers, and then some. The rolls, the drinks, the chicken, all were A+ as was the service and ambiance, even with us staying late after their closing time on a Friday night. Easy to get to location, right on 309 in Montgomeryville, and great mix of choices for anyone.  \n",

Glad we found this place.  Service was great and the portions were huge.  Coffee was good and strong.  Our server Deanna was wonderful.  She's so bright and cheery.  We ordered the steak and eggs to share and it was more than enough.  Service was fast and very friendly.  \n",

We come here to celebrate or have a meal we KNOW will not disappoint.  Housemade blue cheese wedge salad is awesome.  The redfish is a fav.  We love the creamy feta grits.  We've actually loved everything we have ordered.  The house wine is on tap and so good.  The red reminds me of a Malbec.  Chris gave is excellent service.  We can't wait to go back!  \n",

Only weird thing is the bathroom is outside and you need a key (understandable) but I've noticed a lot of small breakfast cafes have strange bathroom situations.  \\n\\nOpen everyday for breakfast & lunch and just recently opened for dinner now!\\n\\nVery busy, fast paced and friendly!!!!!!!  \\nYou seat yourself and sometimes you're gonna have to wait but it moves fast.\\n\\nBesides their menu, they have a small 'Stop Sign' breakfast menu with specials on them along with the daily specials on the walls. \\n\\nA MUST check out place.\\nFamily owned and ran!\\n\\nLocated in between the Chase bank and the Shell gas station, north side of the street.  \n",

This place is always a good choice for traditional and not so traditional Italian fare. Italian happens to be my favorite type of food, and good ol' faithful  Carrabba's is always there to deliver. Where do I start? First off, the food they serve taste fresh and flavorful. Two meal combinations I enjoy is their Mezzaluna pasta and their new small plate dish stuffed mushroom. I also enjoy their traditional lasagna with the small plate meatballs and ricotta (and I normally don't go for traditional lasagna with most chain restaurants, but theirs is so good, I make an exception). The Mezzaluna is their ravioli dish with chicken, ricotta, and spinach covered in a mild tomato sauce. The ingredients seem somewhat understated, but the taste is incredible. I enjoy the taste and texture of the ricotta and sauce. They are also very generous with cheese. I notice that the stuffed mushrooms are in the same sauce and so I smother them in it as I eat it. The second dish pairing I order is the small plate meatballs and ricotta and traditional lasagna. I get a generous size of well seasoned ground meat in a bath of Pomodoro sauce and ricotta. I get enough smooth, rich ricotta to balance out the sauce in this dish. It may seem generic, but their traditional lasagna is not to be missed. Lasagna is by far my favorite food, but it tends to be hard to find a good traditional lasagna in most Italian restaurants. What I love most about theirs is the abundant amount of cheese in the dish and that its not swimming in Pomodoro sauce. The sauce is simply draped on top. Add a large amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese, and I'm in business. Staff is very friendly and welcoming, so its always nice for me to come here. If you've saved enough room, the desserts are pretty good. So far I've had the mini cannoli and the cheesecake.  \n",

The short time I was there they had so many compliments and one man walked in and said he can't stay away. I think there is a good chance that will be my problem.  \n",

When I had to be in Carrollwood, I decided to stop on by here. They were officially not open yet, but they were training, and it was just my luck they were able to serve me. I went with their signature salad since it's my fave added with a hard boiled egg and seared Ahi tuna (my favorite way to have it). What I love about this salad is how well the ingredients work together like the goat cheese, avocado, sunflower seeds, and raisins (which I normally hate, but for the salad, it works because it adds a depth of sweetness to it). I washed it all down with their infused water which has mint and strawberries it. Very refreshing on a scorching hot day. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming in my approach. The food was every bit as delicious as I would expect at any SoFresh, and it's safe to say that Carrollwood is in for a treat!  \n",

The drum with chicken cracklins was a revelation. Picture it: juicy white fish with crispy chicken skin adhered to the top. I would have slapped my mom to get the last bite. Ryan, our server, was very kind and took plenty of time to explain the menu to us and made great recommendations. Stop off at the bar to have a drink with the handsome bar crew before you go to your table. For dessert, be sure to order the apple pie ahead and the white chocolate bread pudding is also a treat!  \n",

Yeah it's a chain and I was reluctant. But I was grateful I gave this place a chance. I had their Signature Dish the Eggs Cochan which is slow-cooked braised pork served over buttermilk biscuits, topped with two poached eggs, and finished with hollandaise sauce. It was just so good. The pork just melted in your mouth. So flavorful and bomb. I would want to come back try their other items at some point in my lifetime. I also had a glass of grapefruit juice; it was typical.  \n",

One is the huge variety on the menu. It ranges from indulgent go-to comfort foods (which for me is of course any pasta and shrimp n grits--which I saw) to lighter fare (I had my eye on the soft shell crab BLT salad). Alas, I came here right after indulging at Chocolate Pi, so I had to narrow down my choice for dinner, which I was very happy with. I went Italian tonight and had their mussels for appetizer and semi healthy with mushroom pasta. What a enjoyed about the mussels is their presentation and seasoning on it. Mussels are one of those appetizers done in many different ways (fra diavlo, white wine and garlic) and I did enjoy their rendition of it. I came in a light broth with tomatoes, spicy sausage, onions, so it had a rather spicy kick that I could actually taste in the mussels themselves. Before guzzling the rest of the sauce with a spoon, I soaked up what I could with the two pieces of bread that it came with. The mushroom pasta I thought was a good choice following the mussels. It looked deceptively light, however, it was somewhat rich. The fettuccine noodles were cooked well and were generously coated with the pesto sauce and topped off with a good heap of mushrooms. I went solo so I did get the single portion of the dish, which was still rather large, so it might be a good idea to split the single portion if you do decide to take a friend with you (unless both of you REALLY love pasta and want the same dish). The service here is also very good: hostess seated me right away and my waiter checked on me rather often. I'm eager to come back, this time with company.  Good place to go for a laid back evening or dinner with friends. I noted that they do have dessert here, so I'll make sure to get some!  \n",

If you want fine Cajun dining with  Louisiana flare with dance hall ambiance you have met your destination. The staff was kind the music and food were great! It was cute to see families taking advantage of the dance floor and enjoying the restaurant. My son and my Mom whom I went with equally shared the same love for this venue. If I go back to New Orleans I would love to come back and try more entrees, like grilled seafood, salads and gumbo etc.  \n",

Haven't been here for a while myself, but was happy to come back. My boyfriend got the filet mignon with lobster tail, grilled vegetable skewers with baked apples, and two bottles of beer. I was more conservative with my meal and got the hearty and healthy version of the six ounce filet mignon with steamed broccoli and side salad. I got the peppercorn parmesan dressing on the side, so I indulged a little. My meal was delicious and satisfying; the filet was well seasoned and tender. I liked how the side salad was a good size with a variety of vegetables. The dressing was delicious and coated my salad well, so I got to enjoy it thoroughly without really feeling like I was eating healthy. My boyfriend loved his meal too; surf and turf is his favorite. He mentioned that both lobster and filet mignon were flavorful and grilled to perfection. The veggie skewer were juicy, yet crisp and well charred. The baked apples had the right balance of sweetness and zest to finish off the meal. The beers were so chilled they almost turned to slush as he poured it into the ice cold frosted glass mug. Our waiter Chase was very friendly and helpful when we were making our selections and was attentive throughout our stay. We love how clean the interior is with casual feel. For two filet mignon dinners, I only paid just over fifty bucks, which is not bad at all. Good place to go if you want high end quality food, but not a stuffy atmosphere.  \n",

It's perfect for the whole family and/or friends with different food preferences. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you won't go wrong! I love the raw cashew cheese wraps and my 10 year old son loves the neatball sandwich! We didn't get a chance to try the desert but they looked amazing and have vegan options.  \n",

We did not know! To be honest, we haven't been here in over a decade & thought TGIF offered only bar food...we were wrong! Amazingly Surprised. \\nRibs, fall off the bone. Parmesan Crusted Chicken: Moist & Full of flavor- are we seriously at TGIF?! 5 star experience...Red Velvet Cake a must for finishers \\n\\nAgain, sorry no pics, we are piggish on our end folks \\n\\n\\nBest Service Goes to Demicia at TGI FRIDAYS #1730!

We had the calamari, branzino, filet banderilleras, gazpacho and olives. Incredibly delicious! The bread was to die for and my \"Burro\" cocktail was very nice. Tapas Tuesday is the best day!  \n",

I have been to City Fish several times before, but haven't been in two years. I came for the Saturday brunch, seeing that they've revamped the menu. The first thing I had was the blackened shrimp and cheesy grits, which was delicious. I knew I had  to come back and try the crab cake benedict. This benedict used crab cake instead of English muffin, which I thought was creative. The crab cake was chunky with crab meat and seasoned well. Each were topped off with fried egg over easy, and smothered with hollandaise sauce. I rounded off my meal with their creamy cheesy grits. Both meals made me remember why I loved this place. The price for the breakfast is not too bad either; one entree will set you back under $20 and are satiating.  \n",

Well, I decided to wake up extra early to give this place a try. It's a basic breakfast/lunch spot with more than affordable prices. Upon entering the place I did notice that everything looked clean and new. The staff was very nice and seated me right away. My waitress was very sweet and and attentive, checking on me often. They specialize in omelets, so despite the extensive breakfast menu, I decided to go with that. The variety was huge and endless it seemed in what kind of omelet to get, but lately my taste has simplified so I went for the Wisconsin Omelet, which is a safe choice and always a crowd pleaser. The omelets all come with a choice of hash browns, home fries, etc., and unless you have the appetite of a lumberjack, I recommend tomato slices or fresh fruit. It also comes with choice of bread, and being that I already ordered lean, I went with the biscuits and gravy. All my food came out rather quickly, but it was all hot and fresh! The biscuits were soft and rich, and came with much more than enough gravy. I cut my my omelet and ate that with the tomato slices. At first glance, the omelet didn't look like much, but once you start cutting into it, its a monster packed with cheese, definitely living up to its name. It had cream cheese in it, which was a nice touch, as I've never seen that before. It gave it a creamy taste that made it pretty unique to most omelets I've had. Definitely worth the early wake up.  \n",

We FINALLY made it in, middle of the week, lunchtime!\\n\\nStill busy, lots of people working.\\nCan't tell who works there and who is just customers.  No uniforms or name tags.\\n\\nOne side of the restaurant is (I'm guessing) air conditioned.  Tables, the bar, possibly booths, didn't notice.  The other side of the restaurant is more of an outside thing.  Yes it's all indoors but one side is open outside air.   That side has games, comfy lounge chairs, and more tables to sit at.\\n\\nFood was good, service was good.\\nI recommend checking the place out.  \n",

I hand picked this place since looking at the menu it had items that we both could enjoy: he was a wings, steak, and drinks kind of guy and I have an undying love of Italian food! I also realized that I love gastropubs; they're definitely high end enough to serve quality food and drinks but without the stuffiness and formality. For my meal I got their baked ziti and the calamari appetizer. My boyfriend got the hangar steak and fries with wings as a starter. He also got three, don't know what they were, but he enjoyed them. He finished off his meal with a vanilla bourbon bread pudding. My ziti was delicious; lightly coated in the marinara with a huge dollop of ricotta cheese in the middle so when I got it I stirred it up so the ricotta was spread evenly. For a normally heavy dish, it was rather light to me and I was able to finish it. It had a good ratio of meat to pasta to ricotta to sauce so there was no overpowering element to it. Calamari was delicious, light, and looked more like a tempura then fried (I know its the same thing, but lighter) and had the right amount of crisp and chewiness. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and was able to answer questions about the items on the menu. Would definitely go back as I did notice a few other items that looked equally appealing.  \n",

They have like a million beers on tap and did I mention the amazing DOG FRIENDLY patio!?!? Love it. It's in a hopin spot along Magazine St with lots of good people watching and passerbys. Great place to spend an afternoon with a friend and/or a pup or two.  \n",

I got the avo sandwich, hippie vegan breakfast bowl, and the spring rolls w quinoa; all were great!!! Those were most of the vegan things on the menu. Building is cool, there's plenty of parking, and while I only did take out, the place looked great to dine in!!  \n",

Then when they reopened from Covid close down, they refreshed the place with more booths.  Everyone loves to sit in a booth.   \\n\\nNow, it's one of my favorite places.  \\nBooth OR TABLE, I like it.\\n\\nTypical cafe food & sometimes not so speedy, \\nbut who cares, where ya gotta be?\\nGive the servers and cooks slack, it's been a hard time on us all!   They are also dealing with that annoying DoorDash/Ubereats.  \\n\\nPlace seems pretty clean.  Food is typical.\\nBathroom is always clean.  Servers (3-4) are all nice.\\nAbout 10-12 available booth/tables, including 2 6-top tables.    No counter space at this time.\\nEasy parking.\\n\\nSupport local business!  \n",

Next time we will come to sample the dinner entrees. The cocktails were very cool and absolutely delicious. The burrata flatbread and the fish tacos were devoured! The noodle salad offerings a variety of taste and textures. It is currently my favorite dish!  \n",

The food is to die for. But what really made the whole experience great is Brent, our server. Efficient, knowledgeable, kind, patient and very likable.

That was an experience!\" -out from out of town! Katie Emily and Norma are incredible! This is my sixth time here and every single time I'm absolutely amazed! I can't seem to get away from the Maui Wowie burger! However this time I tried Jekyll and hide! But everyone who We be in here always shares with me so I've had a bite of just about everything!

We had a fantastic dinner, a group of 10 of us, on Saturday evening. The service was fantastic, the management was more than helpful, coming over to us and checking on our table. Steve, the GM was fantastic. The DJ they had playing, DJ SILVER, was just awesome. We will come back again and again  \n",

They were right next to H&R block, so it made it convenient for me to have dinner there before doing my taxes. This is one of those fast Italian pizza and pasta places but maybe a few notches above. The interior was warm, cozy, and very inviting, reminescent of other classic italian restaurants. Today I was in the mood for something simple, so I got their baked ziti dinner that comes with a side salad and garlic knots. The side salad was much to get excited  over, but I do give major props on the crispy garlicky crotons on top that gave it a delicious crunch. I later on worked on my garlic knots that were nice and soft and came with plenty of garlic butter and crusted with garlic. Then came the ziti. I haven't ziti in years which had always been and old favorite if mine, and with one bite I remembered why it was. It had an ample mix of ricotta and mozzarella that I was able to taste with each bite. It was quite large, but I did manage to finish it. Great place to for some decent no frills Italian in my book.

The interior is clean and classy in appearance, complete with beautiful white table cloth that makes me feel even fancier when I come here. The food is just as good and is and isn't your typical Italian. Most notable would be the scallops and polenta with lobster sauce, their blt salad (not photographed) and the basil pesto chicken fettuccine that I had on my most recent visit. I've also had their classic lasagna which is pretty good, and uses béchamel sauce in it. The staff is very kind and accommodating. I showed up 30 minutes before dinner hour, yet they were willing to let me order off the dinner menu. I ordered their watercress salad to start off my  meal. It was very light and refreshing from the slices of granny smith apple, and the blue cheese and pecans added more layers of flavor and texture. The basil pesto fettuccine pasta came next. This dish had a very buttery flavor to it and went well with the grilled chicken and mushrooms mixed in. As beautiful as the interior is, I enjoyed eating my meal outside which is just as classy and well polished in appearance. It was a perfect spot to people watch and enjoy the beautiful day. I would definitely have to try the brunch next time though.</td>\n",

Being that I lost my sense of taste and smell, my options were fairly limited, but I knew I had to eat something. I was feeling like something light along with something starchy, so I thought this was a good choice. I went with their chicken salad due to my coworker having gotten this a long time ago,   raving about their homemade dressing. So i went with that. I've also had their fried Yuca sticks with spicy cheese sauce. Both items were delicious despite my lack of taste, i could appreciate the texture that came through. I actually did taste the cheese sauce, though mildly, and i could appreciate the spiciness and the rich, creamy texture. The salad itself was quite a sight to behold as it was a rather large size, though not unbearably filling. There was ample chicken sitting on a bed of lettuce, and their thick cilantro dressing was on the bottom. It made for a really good quarantine meal, and I was glad I had the opportunity to try it.</td>\n",

I have been to a dozen Tapas dining, all delicious...This in my top 2 favorites. \\n\\nPart 2: we went again last night for a smaller snack...again, staff is very friendly and hospitable as if it were their own home. The food couldn't be more delicious! Thanks for making our Nashville visit a memorable one.</td>\n",

For this meal, I ordered their caprese salad, which was mozzarella and parmesan cheese and grape tomatoes nestled in a bed of arugula. There was some pesto on the mozzarella, and the salad was complemented with two pieces of sourdough bread. I enjoyed spreading the mozzarella over the bread and made a mini sandwich with the rest of the arugula and tomatoes. For my main course, I had their cavatelli pasta with spinach, pesto, pine nuts, and chopped up butternut squash with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. I loved this dish, as the pesto (which I love) coated the cavatelli nicely and the pine nuts gave it a good crunch. Fair portion too. I actually had to take at least half of it home, and it was good for late evening. My boyfriend had a lobster roll that came with a side salad and told me his meal was wonderful. My coworker enjoyed her crabcakes with salmon immensely. We finished off the night with some drinks. I had their Tryst drink, which was strawberry with vodka, and my companion had Walk on the Pier and a Tryst. Boyfriend had Whiskey Sour. Now, I'm not much of a drinker, so it was a bit strong for my taste, but I enjoyed the strawberry flavor! Great place to go people watch in the middle of Beach Drive! If the weather is nice, I strongly recommend eating Al Fresco to enjoy being part of the scene!</td>\n",

I had no time to really look at everything, so after i did my thing for work, i came right back, not wanting to brave the drive back hungry, and determined to check them out. It was also a gloomy, rainy day, and i was a little irritated that i had to come out this way for work. Luckily, i was able to turn my negative into something positive by using that opportunity to discover a new place! The interior is beautiful, making you feel like you are in a luau with their Tiki statues and decor. With the soft lighting and the ambiance its easy to forget youre in Florida in the rain and not in Hawaii. I was the only customer there, and the owner was training new staff, so I got alot of attention. They gave me time to peruse the menu before making a selection. I did notice they had alot of good sounding cocktails and treats, but I wasnt planning on drinking or splurging, so i looked at the healthier options, which thankfully they had alot of. They had salad, but as usual, I wasnt in the mood for it so i got the Dos Tacos with Ahi Poke and a shot of coleslaw. It was a good choice, as it really hit the spot after a stressful day that felt wasted, but my mood quickly changed. The tacos were generously filled and had ample amounts of Ahi Poke that went great with the Asian slaw. On top of Ahi, there was alot of other stuff in the tacos like some feta, some crisp tasty veggies. The tacos came out bigger than i had expected, so i was fully satiated by the time i was done with the meal. The nice young lady who was my server was very attentive and checked on me frequently to make sure I didnt need anything else. I definitely need to come back at some point for their dessert, and have a few cocktails with my boyfriend. It made my rainy day better, but I would love to see the deck on a clear summer's eve.</td>\n",

For his birthday, I decided to give him a very special treat by coming here for their brunch AND dinner! The nice thing is that it gave me a chance to sample a variety of dishes that they serve here. I started off my day with their Grand Marnier French toast with a side of bacon while my boyfriend had their chicken and waffles and their special $2 mimosa. Our nice waitress let me substitute the potatoes with bacon since I already wanted bacon on the side, and honestly it was good tip because I got pretty full from the French toast alone. I actually really loved their French toast, which was thick and rich, but not heavy. I don't get it very often for one, so when I do, its a nice treat. Theirs was made with Grand Marnier, which actually did come through in the flavor and gave it a nice twist. I really loved the baked apples that came with it as a good finishing touch. My boyfriend of course demolished his meal and loved it. I did notice that it was a large portion. The overall price was not bad at all, and I could see us coming back just for their brunch. \\n     Okay, so seven hours later we were up for round two and had the same sweet waitress we saw at brunch (we even gave her an advance warning we were coming back, so she wasn't too surprised to see us again). Still full from Brunch, I zeroed in on their duck wings, something that I noticed seems to be one of their specialties. I had that with a side of their hard cider cole slaw. I don't drink very often, but this being a tavern, I made sure I at least tried one drink and went for their Blackberry Collins, which to me tasted like a Blackberry juice. It had fresh blackberries and a mint leaf for garnish which gave it a nice touch. I could not taste the alcohol (which is good for me because I don't drink) however, it did sneak up on me after I finished it. The duck wings here were amazing and make me forget any other kind of chicken wing I've ever had. They were large, meaty, and were well coated in a sweet glaze. I had this with their delicious homemade special sauce (ranch?). \\n     Overall, I really enjoyed coming here even though it was for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was wonderful and she was very attentive to our party of six (during dinner). Although I didn't try their actual dinner entrées, the quality shines in the food I got. I could see myself back for their brunch or wings and a drink on a late night.</td>\n",

Their turkey sandwiches are some of the best I've tasted. I think its the mix of their turkey breast with the feta cheese and spreads that really do it for me along with perfectly toasted bread. So far I've tried their Turkey Stack and their Gruben, which is a nice little twist on the Ruben, only theirs has marinated slaw and turkey breast. Their sides are all really good and a unique alternative to the normal potato chips, but I think my favorite is the pasta salad because of the rich feta and basil with sun dried tomato. It has a very rich and complex taste that's not heavy. In my opinion they also have some of the best falafel. I love how perfectly crisp on the inside and soft on the inside they are, no a mushy sloppy mess that I've had with others. The nice thing is that you can have their falafel vegan if you skip the tzatziki and feta and its every bit as tasty (yes, I've tried it both ways). I really like how they display the number of calories on the website as well as their menu in the store as it helps people make better decisions about what to eat, if you're trying to eat healthy. Otherwise, they have decadent sweet treats too if that's your thing (which I need to try).</td>\n",

Its all in the bread, which is basically the same dough as their pizza (and I love and adore pizza!!).What makes Tampa Pizza so special in particular is everything else in the sandwich is high in quality so i keep forgetting theyre a pizza place. Each sandwich is assembled with love and care every time I order one. Their meats are tender and in just the right proportion, well seasoned and cooked. I love their grilled chicken and hand carved turkey. They also come with quality greens, and sauces. My favorite is the Turkey Bacon swiss sandwich which has a generous portion of that tender turkey I love so much, a pile of flavorful crispy bacon, and swiss cheese melted in their delicious organic bread that is the crown jewel of any sandwich. You can pair the sandwich with fries, but the sandwich itself is so filling i opt for the arugula salad. Its not much to rave about, i mean its salad, but its a good side to go with it if your watching your calories and you want help digesting your food so the meal's not so heavy. Admittedly i have yet to have their pizza, but rest assured I plan on it.</td>\n",

I took one look at the menu and was excited that they had a decent variety of offerings: salads, sandwiches, and premium sides like fresh sauteed veggies, pasta salad, and potato salad.  So far I'm more than pleased with this place. I've been here twice and the quality is actually pretty good. The first thing I had was a Havana Cobb salad that had a generous amount of chicken as well as bacon and avocado. I had this to go for dinner and it did the trick filling me up.  On my second visit, i got a two piece dark meat meal which consisted of pasta salad and fresh veggies. What pleased me most was that the veggies were crisp and sauteed, not something bland and boring, boiled to mush. I also loved how the chicken was juicy and fall off the bone tender. I did like the pasta salad, but I wasn't too thrilled that it had pineapple and was more on the sweet side and the portion was bigger than expected.

Food is really important especially when you're traveling on a vacation your expectations are a little higher. \\n\\n  We weren't disappointed at the Fork. We \\nMade a reservation days before. A family member who lives here in town highly recommended this place so we took the suggestion and glad we did. The food was all on point. A few of us had a couple special request and all of that was met. The food all came out really good. My wife got a protein style burger, uncle got a steak, aunt got a Hawaiian chicken of some sort and my self a recommended brisket sandwich. Everyone was happy and the entire plate was cleared. \\n\\n Our servers were Ryan &amp; Rochelle, they did a great job making sure we were taking care of. They knew the menu pretty well explaining things very thoroughly, and were very accommodating. They didn't miss a beat on filling up drinks, sauces, checking in on the meal and making sure the steak was cooked properly. \\n\\n We ended up getting dessert: Butter cake and an epic bread pudding (highly recommend) \\n\\n  If you're looking for good food in Boise I would highly recommend this place and also make reservations it seems to be a popular spot, you will not be let down. \\n\\n Very grateful we found this place. \\n\\nGood job Fork Chefs and good job Ryan &amp; Rochelle \\nTeam R &amp; R \\n\\n-The friendly people from California, don't worry we're only here to visit, keep\\nDoing what your doing.

I propose \"Holy-freaking-build-a-monument-for-it-Super\" ... -Rica.\"  Our Mamma and Papa GRUB used to hit up this spot back in the day, a random dude at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia told me to hit it up (side note ... Arcadia is like 100 miles from SB ... who is this guy? Or better question ... how ridiculously amazing is this place going to be?), and then when I caught my favorite radio show, The Petros and Money Show (PMS), talking them up ... it was like the holy-trifecta of Good Grub recommendation.  And so our mission to hit up La Super-Rica Taqueria was born.  And when my one year wedding anniversary rolled around, what better town to recommend to my bride than Santa Barbara?  Yeah ...  We can check out the amazing beaches, walk around downtown, take a stroll along the bike path down by the Zoo ... and did I mentioned we might be hitting up a legendary taco spot?  Can you say ... romance?  As you pull up to the joint, realizing there's no sign up on the building ... and the line is out the door ... well, let's just say brace for something epic.  I mean seriously ... it's a hole-in-the-wall if there ever was one, but not just a hole-in-the-wall, but a hole-in-the-wall frequented by Julia Child (sorry, but now I can't get this Julia Child SNL video out of my head).  Gazing up at the menu board, I remembered from my days back as a little kid about their amazingly scrumptious tacos, but is was Money from PMS that lead me to hitting up the Chorizo Especial ...  a bowl of gooey, melted cheese encasing hearty chunks of chorizo ... matched up with a pile of fluffy, hot tortillas to make your own mini-taco-quesadilla-creations.  To our order we added a taco de adobado (aka pork marinated in happiness), an order of chile con queso (for my veggie-loving-wife), and a heaping side of guacamole.  As we waited in line, we got to peak into the kitchen and see the fresh, hand-made-tortilla-making action up close.  Everything we got was pretty much unreal ... the meat was flavorful and tender, the tortillas were out-of-this-world, and the queso ... oh man, the queso.  Let's just agree on one thing ... you better make sure you can tolerate some lactose before you hit up La Super-Rica.  The cheese was thick and rich ... so much that Baby Carlos was pretty much in shock over how good it looked ... not at the table Carlos.  We bathed everything in their trio of dangerously good salsas ... a fresca, a roja, and a verde ... all with a tiny bit of bight and a ton of sweet flavor.  It was a magical way to spend our one year anniversary ... or any day for that matter.  So thank you La Super-Rica ... I can tell we're going to make it for the long hall ... is it two early to start thinking about coming back for year two?</td>\n",

So far my absolute favorite one is the horseradish roast beef. The meat is so tender I can rip the sandwich in half. Its nestled in between two soft pieces of ciabatta bread. With any sandwich, its only as good as its bread which is the foundation of a good sandwich. This one's perfect and they toast it. Despite that its still soft and chewy. It also microwaves well if you don't want to eat it right away. What I can appreciate is that the calorie count is is posted on their website so you know what your eating and you can custom build your meal. I like to get this with the cucumber tomato salad to keep the calorie count low. However if you want to indulge, they got you covered there too.</td>\n",

The evening was clear and beautiful, so I dined outside. No reservations are needed; it's just walk right in. The wait staff were attentive and friendly with me and my dinner companion. Our waitress explained some menu items to help us make an informed meal choices. Most of the items I saw were outside of my typical choices when dining out (instead of my usual regulars such as some kind of macaroni and cheese or pizza, I see spaghetti squash pie, pickled watermelon, etc.) which could either be very good or very bad. The duck confit caught my eye as I've been partial to it lately and it's somewhat hard to find in most restaurants. So, in good faith, I had the duck confit and my companion had fish and \"grits\" (it was more of a polenta, I think). We split watermelon and goat cheese bruschetta for an appetizer.\\n    The verdict? Outstanding! I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the watermelon on the bruschetta. For me, watermelon is meant to be a sweet dish, not savory, but the way it was prepared reminded me of marinated tomatoes. It was also very refreshing after having walked all over downtown to find this place. The goat cheese paired very well for a light finish. Not long after our dinners arrived. It looked beautifully arranged and seemed deceptively small in portion. It was the duck leg on top of the spaghetti squash pie sitting on top of a spear of broccoli. Pickled watermelon rind was on the side (again with the watermelon, right?). I started off by eating the watermelon rind. Having been pleasantly acquainted by the bruschetta, I knew more about what I was in for. It kept a sweet and sour flavor to it, almost candy like. Then I reached for the duck leg and broccoli. The very tender duck leg itself slipped right off the bone. The spaghetti squash pie I saved for last. Not surprisingly, it tasted very much like sweet potato pie, but savory. It was a small piece, however, it got me full relatively quickly. But not too full for dessert. \\n    From the time that I entered the restaurant I knew I wanted the honey black pepper cheesecake after seeing so many good pictures of it on Yelp and reading so many good things about it. I had to know if it lived up to the reputation. Well, dare I say that cheesecake is one of best I've tasted (not sure if equal to or better than the Grimaldi's amaretto cheesecake--hard to choose). The mixture of honey and pepper holds a sweet and complex cheesecake flavor along with a light and fluffy texture as I ran my fork through it. You can't taste the black pepper really, but it did add a bit of spice and heat the same way cayenne complements dark chocolate. The cake sat atop a drizzle of honey which I scrapped off along with forkfuls of cheesecake. It had a piece of honey candy (kinda like peanut brittle) that I munched on at the end that was a nice touch to an already incredible dessert. If I were to come back for nothing else, it would definitely be for the cheesecake. Its $12, which is somewhat a steep price for dessert, but for me, it's worth it. My friend had the cheesecake too and seconds my opinion.\\n   Overall, service and food were impressive. I would describe the interior as a little kitschy, yet modern and industrial, so you could come dressed to impress or casual. A few managers checked on us and asked how we were doing and what we thought of the food. I liked how they were engaging and weren't rushed. There are a few other items on the menu I would like to try, so I know I'll be back soon!</td>\n",

The fries i really enjoyed because while the fries itself was well seasoned and crispy, it also had cheese sauce and then a skin of white cheese, bacon crumbles, and topped with jalapeno which was the perfect touch. The prices are reasonable for what you pay for.c\\n Couldnt eat it all in one sitting, so ill be saving some for later for the perfect late night craving!</td>\n",

That being said though, it was first love when eating at Fresh Kitchen which I have heard nothing but good things about. I gave them a try during the height of the pandemic when i had to use Doordash to get my food. All the food there was definitely fresh and top quality. Usually I don't do bowls because I'm not into rice or quinoa and I'm not always in the mood for pasta. Luckily with FK i can customize and control the carb and starch content as well as increase my veggie count. My normal go-to is their four bowl, because it's just the right size for me. Recently, i've discovered that I really love sweet potato noodles, so I go with that and kale slaw as my two bases. For veggies, I do mushrooms (scientifically, did you know that mushrooms and chicken go well together??) and citrus chicken. Today, they were out of the citrus chicken, so went with their baked almond chicken. So glad I did, because the tasty crunch really added another dimension of texture that complimented the flavor. I love to top it all with their delicious creamy white ginger sauce for a cool, mild finish. The customer service here is on point, even when the whole place was jumping with activity and so packed with customers that the line was going out the door. Luckily, despite of that, the line is never long. They offer a lot of desserts and drinks, that I may try at some point when i don't feel like getting my usual.</td>\n",

Today was the first time I got to go in person and even with limitations due to covid, my experience was TOP NOTCH!! There were limited seating areas in the dining room which made for a very comfortable, well spaced out experience. The server, Susan, was absolutely as sweet and helpful as can be! She helped me narrow down what I wanted (which was everything!) and was quick and safe. Susan wore gloves and mask the whole time, and even made doing so look comfortable and easy, which was really nice.  The owner and wonder chef, Caroline, was there too and she personally came out to ask how our meals were. She is so friendly and kind and the food was so out-of-this-world-amazing, it's no wonder this restaurant is a staple in the neighborhood and raved about by the vegan community near and far. The spicy chicken sandwich is to die for!!!!!!!!!! They use their own seitan which is spot on and then cooked to perfection topped with lettuce tomatoes and pickles. I also got sides of cauliwings drenched in tasty buffalo sauce, coleslaw which was so good and refreshing, and the tastiest mac and cheese this side of the Mississippi! I HIGHLY recommend you check it out! Oh and they have daiquiris!!!! I've heard the watermelon and mojito ones are crowd favorites but tbh all the flavors looked and sounded amazing. Can't wait to try one next time I go! Thank you, Kindred for an oh-so-tasty lunch, a wonderful experience, and amazing cruelty free neighborhood restaurant! 12/10 gold stars.</td>\n",

This is a small restaurant located in a somewhat obscure out of the way area in Town n Country, but looks are deceiving.

Seating's limited, however, not impossible for me to get a table and sit comfortably throughout my meal. There's also some seats outside, which is good when the weather is nice. The place was also very clean and smelled good. For my meal, I got the Sopes with shrimp. I've never had sopes before, and I assumed it was like an arepa based on reading the description. However, this was not the case. The sope is a corn cake of sorts, however, outside was crispy like a tortilla chip, inside was soft and chewy like a corn fritter. The melted queso on top gave it a very nice touch. My meal came with shredded lettuce, more crumbled queso, some avocado, and white sauce drizzled on top. On the side was a red sauce that I topped it off with like dressing. The shrimp was right underneath on the cheese. I enjoyed this dish very much, as its something I've never had before. The dish was relatively light, yet filling enough. I had two sopes and the size remind me something of tapas. The two of them only set me back $11 after tip, which is a good deal.

We made a reservation and it was pretty filled up at the later hours so we were there at five and it eas still packed. Our service however was still outstanding and everyone was prompt and energetic. I kept my meal pretty simple since it was not a cheat day for me so I went with petite filet mignon and the Flemings salad. I really appeciate jow the calorie count eas listed on the side of the menu so I could make smart choices. My meal may have been (reasonably) healthy but it tasted decadent and worthy of a Christmas meal. For one thing, my salad had candied walnuts and dried cranberries in it to give it that sweet and tart crunch. My petite filet mignon I ordered medium rare (I refuse to order it any other way) and was well complimented with the horseradish butter even though the meat itself was alteady buttery. I was pretty full at the end, though my boyfriend enjoyed a nice dessert. Perfect place to for a special occassion whether ready to indulge or trying to stay on track.</td>\n",

They also have a display case that showcases some of their own chocolates, which I have to take note to try on a next visit. I ordered the gnocchi carbonara (I love carbonara and I love gnocchi, so this was a treat!) and their shrimp, lobster, and crab soup. From start to finish my meal was outstanding. I loved that they had warm pretzel bread that tasted like it came out of the oven just moments before reaching our table with whipped butter. The soup was slightly more on the thinner side than I usually want in a bisque, however, it had a generous portion of meat. The gnocchi carbonara was delicious and filling with the right amount of meat and sauce with shaved parmesan. For dessert I went with their sea salt caramel crème brulee, which was light and creamy. The service here was great. Our waiter George was very attentive and rather enthusiastic in discussing our menu choices and even helped guide me on my drink selection (since I'm not a drinker). I'm still not a wine drinker though, but the food would have me come back.</td>\n",

I came here on a reservation for one due to what I predicted would be a heavy Gasparilla weekend. I right to do so because the place was slowly getting packed when I arrived and wait times were a good 20-30 minutes long without reservation. Maggiano's has a charm that looks classy and captures something of an old world restaurant feel with the red and white checkered table clothes and low lighting. The lounge music gave the overall atmosphere a nice touch. I had their Maggiano's salad for a side to start. What can I say, but something magical happens when you bring blue cheese and bacon together? The nice thing is that its light enough so I didn't get weighed down prior to my dinner. Now, unfortunately, the bread looked so fluffy and inviting, that I had to help myself to it, only to curse myself later because of the size of my entrée and that I had on skinny jeans. The one thing I forgot about Maggiano's is the large plates all their large entrees came with. Fortunately for me (and my pants; for a change I didn't have to loosen my belt) looks were deceiving. My chicken and spinach manicotti was actually rather light; generous thick portions of chicken and spinach, and the pasta was shrouded over it like a veil. All of it was lovingly smothered with a rich asiago cream sauce and topped with diced tomatoes. The sauce had a nice balance of creaminess and density so it was neither soup like or heavy. The asiago flavor was actually rather light so it didn't overpower.There were three pieces of it, and I managed to eat each one on the separate bread plates (so if it took leftovers it wouldn't look as if its been through a war zone when I put it in the box). I actually managed to finish the whole meal and was too full for dessert. I've heard the cheesecake here is incredible, so I'll have to remember to get it on my next conquest.</td>\n",

However, I frequent two restaurants in the plaza and curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to check it out. This place makes about 15 different varieties of chicken salad that they serve you in a variety of ways, including number of scoops with choice of side (side choices were rather decent), or sandwiches. Upon entering, I was greeted by a few cheerful, welcoming employees, who were also helpful when time came for me to make my selection. I chose a single scoop of the Olivia's Old South chicken salad (which is a more traditional style with eggs and sweet pickles) and a side of pasta salad. My order came rather quickly. I had six packs of wheat crackers, one pickle spear, and a snickerdoodle cookie. Every item on the plate was delicious. The chicken salad tasted very fresh and had the right balance of chicken to mayonnaise ratio. I enjoyed scooping it up with the crackers, then had the last of the chicken salad wrapped up in the lettuce leaf it sat atop of (WOW!! It made a great wrap! I'll eat it this way from now on!). I finished off my treat with the pasta salad, which was lightly dressed with feta cheese and olives. I didn't eat the cookie though. I gave this to my boyfriend, who told me it was very good, so I'll take his word on it! Up at the front counter where you order, they sell each flavor of their delicious chicken salads and their pimento cheese salad in take home containers. I couldn't help eyeballing the pimento cheese salad. I'll probably take it home to go on my next venture out there!</td>\n",

That being said, my new favorite is definitely their Sassy Scotty, with the ranch, cheddar, and bacon.  If you want a good meal, I strongly recommend getting the sandwich (croissant is my bread of choice!) and get a side of their broccoli and bacon salad. Or get pasta salad or grape salad, if you want something different. The meal comes with their soft and tasty frosted sugar cookie.

This is a rather unique restaurant that offers both curries as well as pub favorites and British specialties. From the inside the décor conjures up images of pubs and restaurants how I would picture it. Some notable dishes I've had before was the mild red curry with shrimp, vegetarian Shepard's pot pie (highly recommended), pierogies, cream cheese stuffed jalapeños, and baked brie. For my last visit, I got their English pasty at the recommendation of my awesome waitress when I was not sure between getting Sheppard's pie or the former.  I was glad I got the pasty (turnover) because it had this wonderful thick brown herb gravy and it was wrapped in a flaky dough. Come to think of it, I'm something of a sucker for all bready items that are flaky, and this did not disappoint. The filling itself was wonderfully seasoned beef with veggies and potatoes and reminded me of the lumpia (Filipino eggroll with ground beef, chestnuts, peas, and raisins--sounds me but it is amazing!!) filling my mother used to make on special occasions. The turnover was rather large, but I was able to finish it. This dish comes with a choice of either rice or fries as a side--I highly recommend getting the fries over the rice, you won't be sorry. I loved how it came with peas so I can feel a little better about eating my vegetables. I got extra gravy for $1.5 (soooooo worth it!!! I put it on my fries when I got home and was in heaven!). For a finishing touch, I got their bailey's Irish cream cheesecake. It didn't taste like Bailey's to me...just regular cheesecake with Bailey's drizzle on it and I'm not sure if that's how it was meant to be, but it was still a good creamy cheesecake. With the large variety of foods to choose from, you and your company are bound to find something you'd like!

The cuisine is not quite the typical Italian restaurant food, but it has a good selection if you want to either stick to your basics or steer from high carb and fattening dishes. I came in for the early dinner in which $15 dollars got you a appetizer, a smaller size of the main course, and a smaller size dessert. This was a very good deal considering the amount of food you get that would not leave you feeling sick and overstuffed at the end. For my three course dinner special, I chose the house salad, tortellini carbonara (even though that's not the official name on the menu, but that's basically what it was) and they gave me a petite cannoli for dessert. The salad was a decent size, and very light, so I wasn't overly full by the time the main course came. I really enjoyed the Tortellini Romagna (carbonara) as it had a different twist to this pasta dish. The tortellini was light coated with the sauce and was bursting with ricotta. The peas and prosciutto were added a perfect touch to the meal. I didn't get to choose my dessert, but I did love the mini cannoli which was small enough for me to enjoy and savor. Good place to go for either a casual day out or intimate dinner date.</td>\n",

It's been too long since I've last had sushi, so I decided to go ahead and give this place a try since I'm in the area. I notice that it has a very beautiful and sleek interior. Somewhat quiet, but it had a few patrons in. The service was very attentive, courteous and friendly. I'm glad they did not rush me at all. I ordered my normal favorite pairings. Salad and sushi roll, but this time ordered soup as well. I started off with their ginger salad. Salad was exceptional and what I would expect, though I love that the ginger dressing all had a thick texture so I could evenly coat the fresh salad veggies with it. I followed up with their miso soup that had strong flavor in the broth and was generous with the tofu. Then came my roll, the rather aptly named Screaming Orgasm, which is a cooked, baked roll with salmon, krab stick, scallions, and its wrapped in seaweed and topped with spicy mayo. This roll has always been a favorite of mine at other sushi places and this roll definitely delivered! It wasn't heavily overwhelmed with the mayo and I loved how the salmon was wrapped around the outside. It fell apart as I tried to pick it up with the chopsticks, so I was less than graceful eating it, though I enjoyed it all the same. I finished off my meal with their sweetened iced Thai coffee with cream. It was my first time having iced Thai coffee. The bold coffee flavor went well with the sweetness of the cream, so it satisfied my sweet tooth. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in the area for my cupcake!</td>\n",

They have pasta, salad, sandwiches, and coastal inspired dishes. For today's visit, I decided to deviate from my usual pizza and pasta fare and opt for sone different. I feelin' a little like tex-mex so I picked out an app and a small plate. I went for their chicken club egg rolls with their street corn small plate. For my drink, their mango strawberry spritzer and of course, key lime pie for dessert. The spritzer is refreshing, especially for the insanely hot, humid weather we were having with a light taste of mango and strawberry. It is about as close to a soda as I will ever get (havent touched the stuff in several years). My street corn came next. It made me realize how much I really love corn with the creamy, but lightly sprinkled feta over it that melted into the corn when stirring it around, giving it a nice bite. I sopped up the remainder of the cheese with the sourdough it came with. Finally, my egg rolls came out, six MASSIVE pieces that came with two kinds of dipping sauce. As a word of caution, unless you are sharing it, do not get this unless you are having it as your meal (which I do quite often with apps). It looks small, but man is it filling. Between the crisp bacon, creamy avocado and melted cheese all wrapped up and deep fried, my mouth was in heaven and my belly satisfied. It went great with the ranch and the spicy sauce so I divvied up the rolls accordingly. I was pretty full at the end of the meal, so I went ahead and got the key lime pie to go to enjoy for home. It was a nice, tart creamy finish to a great meal.</td>\n",

The menu items do come and go, as they switch up their offerings depending on what's in season, but I always manage to find something I like. Some of the offerings they have dont even sound healthy, but shockingly, they are. I'm talking about their meatloaf (which they improved immensely, and I'm a sucker for their cauliflower mash) bbq beef with mac n cheese, and pumpkin cheesecake. That's right. Pumpkin. Cheesecake. So light, creamy, and rich, it actually manages to RIVAL its unhealthy full-fat counterpart. It provides a nice hearty three forkfulls (cause i may be kinda a pig, but not a slob) and finish great with black coffee. My other fave is their bbq beef mac and cheese. Tender, sweet tasting, hearty pulled bbq beef with burnt edges and creamy mac and cheese fills me up and satisfies me. This dish is so good it has me wondering what the point of a cheat day is if my normal work food is just as good if not at times better???!! They also have fresh breakfast entrees that I like to get for my Sunday \"morning brunch\" even though im not brunching and im going to work, but im not feeling bloated and weighed down. There's a large selection to choose from there. Love their sweet potato pancakes with bacon the most, along with their french toast and banana oatmeal bake (which is rather unique and original!). The new packaging makes the food last forever, which is a big plus, and you still get a discount for bringing clean packages to recycle. What's NOT to love???</td>\n",

Again, it was Gasparilla day so the place was pretty empty and quiet, but we were greeted right away by our friendly server. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and there are big screen TVs on the walls which entertained my boyfriend for a little while before we were ready to order our food. I got boneless garlic parmesan wings and broccoli cheddar bites, while Rob got bone in wings. The food came out nice and hot. Rob (who's usually a fussy eater and writes off places with the SLIGHTEST transgression) was happy with his wings. I haven't had boneless wings in forever, so this was a nice treat. I loved how the wings were juicy and not at all greasy, unlike a lot boneless wings I've had in the past. As great as the wings were, for me what wowed me were actually the broccoli cheese bites! When I first ordered it I wasn't sure what I was getting and thought I would get a floury piece of deep fried broccoli with some cheese in the batter. Instead what I got was this amazing hot gooey, velvety mix of broccoli, bacon (nice surprise), and cheddar all held together in a crispy shell. Just think of the best broccoli cheddar soup but a lot thicker inside fried batter. I would definitely come back for another visit for the broccoli cheese bites, but Charann's has a lot more to offer. I didn't try their cheesesteaks that they're famous for, but they do have a huge variety of other food try.</td>\n",

My boyfriend of course got ramen, which I'm not that into, but i did think their chicken app looked pretty good. I also got their pork belly bao bun, which my boyfriend ordered and we splut it. Everything we had was fesh and tasty. I really loved the chicken and the Sriracha sauce. For one it was flavorful, but not at all greasy. The bao bun had the right balance of juicy meat and crisp veggies. I remembered getting these at Anise gastrobar, which I really miss dearly, so it was nice to get my hands on them again. All the staff there were really nice and in a jovial mood along with the crowd. I was also impressed with how quickly the food came out.

              "      <td>Decided to start the New Year at this place, nestled in Hyde Park! I really love Italian food, and I'm always open to going to new places, so while I was out getting a cupcake at Sprinkles, I thought I'd stick around and try them for dinner. Forbici has a beautiful, modern vibe in the interior, serving up both classic and new world Italian. It was incredibly packed today, so I decided to go ahead and have dinner at the bar, which does offer full service. The seat was nice and comfortable and I was acknowledged immediately by my awesome server. The moment we made eye contact, she greeted me with a smile, a drink of ice water, and my menus. As much as I love unconventional innovative Italian food, i decided to go classical. Lately, as I've gotten older my tastes have seemed to simplify, and to be honest, it's not a bad thing since plain and simple does not equal boring and mediocre. Case in point, i decided to go with a meatball appetizer and some cacio e pepe spaghetti. Its my answer to the classic spaghetti and meatballs, only somewhat modified, since im not quite a spaghetti and meatballs kind of girl. The meatball app is rather small and simple: two, soft, tender meatballs sitting atop some of their red sauce. You can add some ricotta for 2 extra, which I did because i love it and it added more flavor and texture. The app was delicious and i love the portion size: big enough for me to appreciate, small enough to leave room for more food! I have been DYING to eat some cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) since i've heard so much about this simple dish (and its shocking that as much Italian as I've eaten, I've never had it before), i was excited to get my hands on it. They offer half or full portion size. I went with half, and was grateful that I did. The spaghetti was al dente, wonderfully coated in butter, and generously sprinkled with parmesan cheese and pepper. It had this great flavor that reminded me of macaroni and cheese, but very mild with a nice kick in the end from the pepper. Overall wonderful place and service, a big shoutout to my server who despite was slammin and busy never missed a beat from start to finish!</td>\n",

For those are not familiar to the CSC concept, they offer an insane variety of chicken salad. Before, I would have never fancied myself a chicken salad kinda gal, but one taste of this seemingly simple concept and I was seriously in love. I'm huge fan of pretty simple lunch food (but ONLY if done right) and the quality of CSC shines bright. For me, I'm a savory kind of gal, so I go for either Sassy Scotty ( bacon, ranch, cheddar) or Kickin Kay Lynne (almost the same as Sassy Scotty, but hot). I pair this up with a croissant to make a sammich (my usual) and get their delucious broccoli salad as the side (perfection with bacon bits and cheddar cheese with some kind of dressing that i cant identify that's so good i tip my head back and drink what's left in the cup) The meals come with a cookie,but yoy can buy a decorated frosted cookie or a marshmallow treat if that's not enough. They also have monthly dessert specials that's worth noting. What i love about this location is that it's so easy for me to get to. It's always clean, and the staff here are always polite and prompt. Definitely one of my regular spots now.</td>\n",

This time, I went with my sister on a Tuesday, so of course, we went with the variety of tacos for Taco Tuesday! They had 4 different kinds of tacos, topped with amazing sauces and pico, each was delicious!! They are not offering dine-in right now, so we took our food to-go and enjoyed it at home. Service was friendly, helpful, and quick! Also try their watermelon cucumber lemonade, it was soooooo good, the BOMB! Wear a mask and enjoy the walls. Six stars if I could.</td>\n",

We were seated and greeted quickly by our server who was friendly and attentive. I loved how he was able to answer questions I had about some of the menu items. For my dinner I had the arugula salad with warm goat cheese, lobster bisque, twin lobster tails, and truffle macaroni and cheese. I had the red dragon mojito to wash it down with. The salad was fresh and crisp and very lightly dressed with champagne vinaigrette. The goat cheese gave it some added flavor and texture so it was a bit more filling. Then the lobster bisque came out. We're served a piece of bread with lobster meat in a bowl before the soup is poured on top. I've had lobster bisque at many places, and I can say that each place does it very different. Not my favorite, but it was very good, very much on the creamy side. What I can say was some of the best that I've had is the twin lobster tails and the macaroni. The lobster was very large, thick. The wait staff deshelled it for me. The meat tasted very fresh and sweet. I skipped the butter that it came with since I didn't feel it needed it. Their truffle macaroni and cheese won me over as well. It had the strong truffle flavor to it, but it wasn't thick or heavy and had a light white cheddar flavor. Their red dragon mojito was the perfect companion with the whole meal. It was sweet, crisp, and had a generous amount of mint and muddled strawberries. I'm a very light drinker, so this was perfect for me. My boyfriend is a very picky eater himself, and felt that was the best meal of his life. My only regret was that I was much too full to have their dessert at the end. I'll have to make this a goal for my next visit though. The meal was $266 and with tip I paid $300. It's a lot, but I feel that this place was worth the splurge.</td>\n",

We suggested they pair the fried chicken with the waffles for their brunch menu and I hope they start offering that.  We also sat next to another couple who had ordered the Fried Chicken Platter because after going vegan the husband was craving fried chicken.

Where do I begin? I love the exterior of this restaurant, which reminds me of a gothic castle with the tall black gates, so its a great place to go for Halloween (which happened to be around the time I went both times). The interior has a lot of character as well; high ceilings, beautiful chandeliers and carpeting. My sister swears that the place could have been a theater before. Of course, no restaurant is worth its salt without good food, and this place delivers! For this visit, I had the deviled eggs appetizer and filet mignon as the entrée accompanied by sautéed mushrooms and spinach. My meal was accompanied by crispy onions which went well with my filet mignon and parmesan encrusted roasted tomato. My sister and I loved the deviled eggs appetizer topped candied bacon. My sister was very pleased with her spinach salad and she's pretty hard to please. Customer service here is top of the line. She was nice enough to take a photo of me, my boyfriend, and sister, who was visiting. I would rank this as one of the top places to go when in Ybor.</td>\n",

The nice thing is that it's a good opportunity to try some thing new. One thing is consistent with this place though is that they have rather unique dishes that could suit any taste. For me, I usually get some kind of pasta (which is always excellent). I started off with the cauliflower and bleu soup which I thought was different. Tasted amazing, like a cheese soup, but it was cauliflower, and the little bit of bleu cheese added more complexity to the flavor. I regret not getting a bowl, but I had to save my appetite on my meal. I really love gnocchi, and see that this was sweet potato gnocchi, I knew that dish was what to get. I ordered it custom requested though, because I added duck confit to my meal, and this does not normally come with duck. I really love duck and its kinda hard to find for some strange reason. Its an $8 dollar upcharge, but I think its more than worth it. The flavor from the duck confit blended so well with the sweet potato gnocchi, bacon, and brussel sprouts that it almost tastes as if it was meant to be this way. This was also the first time I sat outside coming here, and it was right at a prime beautiful location to people watch and pet dogs, so I did enjoy dinner with a view.</td>\n",

I asked the waitress if I could order from the dinner menu anyway because I was looking forward to specific dishes. She was very gracious and said she would ask the kitchen, and they were willing to let me order the dinner items. My lamb meatballs and vegetable farfalle with goat cheese arrived promptly. The same dinner I had a year ago was just as good as I remember. I loved their lamb meatballs! They were soft and filled with greek cheese. There was Siracha sauce on the plate that I dipped them in. My pasta was fresh with a variety of vegetables in it. I usually don't go for nuts in the pasta, but the walnuts they had in it gave variety in the texture of the dish. All complemented with goat cheese and cream sauce that was rich, but not too heavy. My waitress checked on me often.

This is a great semi upscale place to eat that won't put too big of a dent into your savings account. I decided to go for simple yet tasty today and decided to get a lobster tail (single) with au gratin potatoes for the side (which I havent had in YEARS due to mostku picking mac n cheese) and asparagus for some tasty veggie nutrition. For my drink I had a ginger mint lemonade. First off, it was pretty hot out, so I was so greatful for the the refreshing cold drink. I was surprised how crisp and light the taste was of the lemonade, not at all heavy hitting with sugar or overwhelmingly sour. Probably the best lemonade I've ever had. Dinner came ratherbpromptly after. I enjoyed the sweet tender lobster tail that tasted fresh and detached easily from the shell. The asparagus was nuce and firm, well seasoned in butter so it was a good light, yet filling companion. I live lobster, but U have to admit that my favorite part of the meal was the su geatin potatoes that I saved last. Dense and cheesy, I almost thought it was mac and cheese! Very happy with their quick friendly aervice too and hoping I can go back when the social distancing is over.</td>\n",

The vegetarian dishes in my opinion are much better than vegetarian options at most restaurants. The food I get is always hot and fresh. My favorite pizza to get there is the Gourmet white pizza (I'm a sucker for white pizza). I've had white pizza at many places and love their version of it. Theirs has feta cheese and is heavy laden with mozzarella and a blend of other cheeses for a unique taste. The pizza crust is soft and topped off with more parmesan cheese. A personal pizza has four slices and I polish this off with no problem. Now hands down their spinach and artichoke dip is by far the best that I've had. Why?? Well, the cheese makes the difference. There's a thick skin of the mozzarella cheese on top of the creamy layer of dip underneath. Goes very well with the toasted bread its served with. If you want to go healthy(ish), get the stuffed Portobello cap with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, and mozzarella. It sits on top of a fresh bed of greens with balsamic drizzle. Just a fair warning: this is not the place to be if you're in a rush, at least not when dining in. Service is always friendly, but it can be a bit slow. The last two times I came here it took a while for me to be seated. This depends on the day and hour you go and their staffing. However, the food does come out in decent timing (about 5-10 minutes) once you get a table. So if you're having a lazy day and want good food to nosh on, bring your appetite and be mellow.</td>\n",

If I don't get pizza, I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip. I've had spinach artichoke dip in many places throughout the years, and this is actually the best in my opinion. Why??? Because of the thick cheese crust it comes in. Reminds me of pizza with no crust. They supply you with a lot of tasty garlic toasts to go with the dip. I somehow run out of bread (which is another shocker, because normally I run out of dip before I run out of bread or pita chips) and I end up spooning the rest of the dip. Another plus because I am NOT a fan of tortilla chips and more often than not this would stop me from getting dip. So if you love pizza and bread, this is the place!</td>\n",

I can't even describe how amazing the food is!!!! The mushroom tibs are seriously, indescribably, incredibly, amazing. We got the Veggie Combo and they made us a huge array of amazing authentic Ethiopian dishes, (cabbage, lentils, chick peas, beets, greens, red lentils, a cold \"villain\" dish that was amazing, and more), plus they even made us the mushrooms tibs specially on a Wednesday (they are usually offered as a special only on Mondays). They ALSO made us an extra traditional sauce/side (the dark reddish one in a bowl in my photos, sorry I can't remember the name). It felt like we were a guest in a beautiful home, the ambiance and experience are comfortable and delightful. Prince helped us order and everything he suggested was easy and perfect. We started with an order each of the lentil and collard green Sambusas, which were crispy and incredibly tasty. The Sambusas came out quickly and piping hot! The veggie special was served on a beautiful large platter atop a huge piece of injera with an additional 8 huge injera rolls (there were 4 of us, so this was PLENTY for us all)! The injera was spectacular, best injera I've ever had in the U.S., hands down. Prince was so informative about everything we ordered and we loved every bit of it. We even got an extra special taste of Ethiopian coffee and coffee roasting ceremony. All the staff was pleasant, happy, and helpful!

I arrived somewhat late for my reservation, but luckily they still had my spot. The hostess was kind enough to watch Blueberry for me so I could go to the restroom and enjoy the rest of my meal. For today's dinner, I picked a pretty simple, yet outstanding selection. I love Italian food, and I love cheese, so the choice was pretty obvious. For my appetizer, I went with their provoleta supreme, which is melted provolone, bacon, tomatoes, all gloriously blended together in a small cast iron skillet. It came with a small basket of very fresh breads that I used to make mini grilled cheese sandwiches. For dinner I had their porcini ravioli. I thought about getting cheese, but then realized that might be too heavy considering that I was already getting cheese for an app. If you love mushrooms, get this. The ravioli is stuffed with mushroom and on top of the dish is more mushroom. It was topped with a shockingly light alfredo sauce and grated parm. Overall the meal itself was pretty filling, but still managed to be shockingly light since for one the portion sizes were reasonable, so I had no problem finishing whatsoever. The overall quality of the food was also outstanding as was the ambiance. I would definitely look forward to coming back with my dog.</td>\n",

For one, it looks like they have more options to pick from (I'm not a rice eater, and I recalled a lot of their main dishes have rice). For another, they have more healthy options, or at least they clearly label how many calories their dishes contain. Since I came out here on a non cheat day, I opted for what seemed healthy: their jackfruit tacos. Comes with a side of tomato salad. All this sets you back some 600 calories. To my surprise, the tacos were very good: generous on the filling, which had a good variety of veggies on it, and had a lot of flavor from the sriracha aioli. I should point out also, that this was the first time I've had jackfruit and I did enjoy the taste and texture of this meat substitute. It came with a side of marinated tomato salad which was a nice touch. The whole meal was filling and does not leave you feeling deprived like a lot of \"healthy\" options do. Just be warned if you are vegan that I don't think the sriracha aioli is vegan, but I love it just how it is.</td>\n",

This is one of those places that always leaves me nostalgic, bringing me back to my college days when my parents would pay me a visit and take me out here for brunch and on those Thanksgivings past when i would pick myself up some turkey dinner and pie. While the food itself is most definitely nothing fancy, its always hot and fresh when i order it, and notably not greasy, which makes it a popular spot for seniors. My personal favorite meal is always the savor size turkey and dressing, which you can order a scoop of mashed potatoes for your side (because what ELSE would go well with turkey and dressing??). I always get a bowl of extra gravy on the side, which they are more than happy to serve at no extra charge. You can go for biscuits or bread (btw, they make a wonderful pumpkin bread as well as their delicious banana bread!) though lately, I've been going for the biscuits. Soft, fluffy, and melt the butter on contact, it's a nice treat to get before the meal. Like i've said, the food is not at all greasy, so the turkey dinner itself hits the spot without making me feel sick. I like to get a whole pumpkin pie to go for the next few day's worth of breakfasts (don't judge).  I always request they pre-slice, which they are always more than to do.</td>\n",

I've been eating here for years, and although I've tried out a lot of menu items on the list, I do have my absolute favorites! For me, its between their Manchester Farms Quail dish and the Nantucket Scallops. The quail is definitely much leaner than chicken, and has a gamey complex flavor to it that chicken lacks. Their quail is stuffed with mushroom risotto, spinach, and bacon, so this meals stands well on its own, but I would recommend complimenting it with their butternut squash soup for more fall flavor. My other favorite is the Nantucket Scallops. These scallops absorb the brown butter flavor of the sauce and it is somewhat similar to their caramelized sea scallop. I love the ravioli that comes with it, as its light, sweet, yet rich in taste. The arugula is a nice finishing touch that I like to mop up the rest of the sweet sauce in, which balances out the bitterness. Of course, these two items are for very limited time, so I make sure I get these as much as possible. Also notable is their lobster and fresh mozzarella flatbread, which is luckily a mainstay in their menu.</td>\n",

This helps you make informed choices regardless of what you get. I got the lobster flat bread and paired it with the arugala salad with mushrooms. The flatbread itself was perfectly crisp, tender generous portion of lobster, a sprinkling of mozzarella, and some shallot for added crunch. The salad was great too. Normally arugala is a bitter vegetable, but they balanced theirs quite nicely with the truffle dressing and shaved parmasean on top. Waiter was very on point; friendly, professional, and always made sure my water glass was filled. Their dessert offerings are astounding but not over filling as they are served in shot glasses. Great place to indulge if healthy is not your thing and does not necessarily leave you wanting more. I skipped dessert this time, but I've had them before and can vouch for it.

So far I've only had their sandwiches. I've had the Bavarian and their Rustic that had prosciutto and chicken. Both the breads and the meats on their sandwiches are so soft I can rip them in half with my fingers with no effort. They use high quality ingredients and sauces in tasty combinations. The Bavarian has roast beef with bacon and horseradish sauce. But my favorite is definitely the Rustico sandwich. I love the mix of pesto, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto. Comes with chips, but I like to substitute this with their tasty orzo pasta salad, which is an upcharge of $2, but with the portion that I get is not a bad deal. Their food is on the pricier side; I would compare this to Panera. Good option to go to if you want a tasty unique sandwich.</td>\n",

I substitute the chips for side of their orzo pasta salad to round off the meal. Their seemingly plain deli sandwiches are made wirh the most tender cuts of meat and are petfrctly nestled on a soft roll. I can easily rip the sandwiches with my fingers with not alot of effort. My other favorite is half size salad with a cup of their tomato bisque soup. No exaggeration, they make THE best tomato bisque I've ever had with the rich tomato flavor and hearty croutons in it.

As predicted this place was packed so we made sure to make a reservation months advance. We were ushered in right away and were placed in one of the dining rooms. The interior was classy and gorgeous, each table covered with a classic white table cloth. Our server was prompt to get us our drinks and shortly after our order for that evening's dinner. For my meal, I ordered the lobster bisque to start, followed by the twin lobster tails. My boyfriend got the French onion soup and surf and turf meal. The lobster bisque arrived as a large bowl with clumps of lobster meat. They pour over the rich bisque on top of that. The soup was rich and creamy with a wonderful lobster flavor and what I detect was sherry. Then came tge lobster tails. The tails were already seperated from the shell so they took a good lot of the work for you. They were nestled on top some corn and little potatoes with a spicy peppery cream sauce. The lobster meat was sweet to taste and was a good contrast to the chili pepper sauce. It seemed like a small amount on the plate, but i actually got quite full at the end. My boyfriend finished off his dinner with their famous warm butter cake topped with vanilla ice cream. I took notice how the cake seemed to jiggle a little and sorely regret how full I was, but my boyfriend managed to finish it and said it wss very good. I'll probably get it on my repeat visit there on the not too dustant future.</td>\n",

How good your experience is depends on what you get though. Recommended items are the chickens wings, oysters, crawfish, and gator. Gator and crawfish is not offered in too many other restaurants that I know of, and they do this well. Also they have the best key lime pie in my opinion than anybody else. (Most other key lime pies I've had taste artificial, loaded with hard whipped cream, overly sweet or overly sour...blech.) For today's visit I had the gator tail and crawfish tails with dipping sauce. I love how their fried foods are not greasy and the breading is well seasoned. They also have this awesome sauce that comes with the crawfish that have some Cajun kick to it and its housemade. Their dinners come with two sides and I got coleslaw and hushpuppies. Their coleslaw is great: lightly coated with dressing dusted with paprika and spices. They are even a music venue where you can walk over to their \"SkipperDome\" and catch a live music act.</td>\n",

The pies are 12 inches, but they're thin crust so its easy to tackle in one sitting if you come in hungry. As much as i love the pizza, i need to confess that the one thing i drop by here for more than anything is actually their cheesecakes. Massive, creamy, and packed with flavor, these beauties come in a huge variety of flavors that rival Cheesecake Factory--but fresh (not that I'm hating on Cheesecake Factory). Throughout the years I've had many: Amaretto, Irish Cream, Red Velvet, Coconut Caramel, Strawberry (my new fave since they no longer carry the Amaretto), pumpkin, and eggnog (another one I really wish they had kept).

Grimaldi's has wood fired New York style pizza, and they use water that's supposed to be similar to the filtration system in New York to give it a more authentic New York taste. One of my personal favorites are definitely their white pizza with garlic, though I doctor it up with ricotta cheese for added creaminess and texture. My other favorite is their Quattro Formaggio (four cheese) which is also a white pizza. I might like this one slightly better than the former because of the gorgonzola cheese in it that gives it an extra bite.They also offer flavored teas depending on season. The one I got today was strawberry watermelon with chunks of watermelon in it, so it was even more refreshing. Of course, my trip here can't be complete without their New York style cheesecake for dessert. These cheesecakes are the creamiest, smoothest, and freshest tasting I've ever had. My favorites are definitely their coconut caramel cheesecake as well as well as their strawberry cheesecake. Make sure you eat light before getting here or you won't have room for it. These cheesecakes are pretty big.</td>\n",

First, I was very impressed with the beautiful, clean interior of the restaurant. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and were able to guide my meat eating vegan naïve boyfriend of what kinds of foods would suit his palate. All three of us (friend's hubby only got water) had the Avo Blt. My friend and I each got it with the Seminole corn chowder, and boyfriend got his with kale chips. The food was outstanding, and somewhat surprising with flavor. Their eggplant bacon had the crunch and texture of real bacon, just much leaner. The sandwich came in a flatbread which looks like a cracker, however, it was tender and held up very well as I ate my sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised how the corn chowder's chilled temp did not put me off at all! It had a nice little kick from the pico de gallo and the cashew cream gave it the thickness and consistency of traditional corn chowder. Honestly, I think this tastes better than traditional, and I've had a lot of soup.

The inside is sleek and elegant in appearance with comfortable seating, so I was able to alternate between people watching while eating and drinking and going on the dance floor with ease. They have wonderfully crafted drinks in a full liquor bar. I very seldom drink (like maybe 2-3 times a year, normally a max of two drinks each time),but I've had three drinks and a shot here before. I got a great buzz from them, but no hangover, so they pass my unofficial and unscientific test of quality. They have small bites of food available that go great with the drinks, which is perfect for late night. Among the foods I've had here are their charcuterie selection (not the best, but very good!!), deviled eggs, and high end bar snacks like the Stinky Bunz. If I can think of one thing to come here for, it would definitely be the Stinky Bunz. I would describe them as mini fluffy clouds of heaven. Actually, they are soft buns filled with variety of filling of your choice. So far I've had Chinese BBQ and Panko Shrimp. You can either get these as a duo or a trio, but I suggest Trio because they are so tiny and they are addicting to eat! For my last visit, I had the panko shrimp which included a little bit of mayo and slaw. I paired this with their delicious deviled eggs (wasabi lobster) and a light beet and goat cheese salad. The food is a little pricey, but quality is very good. The best part for me is I can order a few small plates and make a decent meal of it. Not to be missed if out and about it downtown!</td>\n",

What was the nice surprise about Dave and Buster's is that their healthy options are actually pretty good. I noticed that there were a few things that looked great that weren't just salad. I opted for the Ancho Caesar Grilled Chicken Lettuce Wrap because I do love the combination of avocado, chicken, and bacon. They absolutely did not disappoint. It wasn't overly messy to eat and was actually pretty filling for a light bite. The parmesan cheese added the right touch. I went ahead and bought a game card for $3 and put $12 on it for 60 points which actually went a long way. It was 1/2 off price for games, so that would explain it, but still a very good deal. There were a lot of different games I could choose from, and I didn't have any wait time. The service there was good; we had an issue with the air hockey table and they were responsive to the issue right away. To me, this would be a perfect place to spend a fun date night with some drinks and good food. Next time I'll probably get a drink and try one of their less healthy apps and game with my boyfriend.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The fog rolled in yet rested in Carpinteria. We were foolish to not stop for breakfast in Ventura. As soon as my family and I drove into Ventura, California, we saw the Amtrak train famous for the views of California. My son had never ridden an Amtrak train, especially one so grand as the Pacific Surfliner that rides the waves along the coast from San Luis Obispo to San Diego. My son jumped on the Surfliner in Ventura and rode with his mother up to Santa Barbara, where I drove to pick them up. But we had to return to Las Vegas for Super Bowl Weekend, so we turned quickly south without breakfast in Santa Barbara. My son was famished. Hungry, he asked repeatedly for me to pull the car over, so we turned west on Linden Avenue in Carpinteria. The beach resort town of Carpinteria was gorgeous, magical, still covered in fog, you could feel mist from the waves hitting your face, and the restaurant near the ocean that we pulled over to eat at was called Esau's Cafe. There were people standing outside, eating at new tables set up outside, because every local seemed to want to eat breakfast at Esau's Cafe each Sunday morning. Since then, we have returned to Carpinteria many times just because of the great dining experience was engaged in at Esau's Cafe. Crab Cake Eggs Benedict with fresh baked biscuits, muffins, seafood tacos with fried fillets of fish, my son had the grilled calamari steak sandwich with a combination of hot onion rings and french fries - his first calamari steak ever. The platters around us were impressive with waffles, pancake layers fluffy thick inches off each plate, and as I took a tour of our colorful surroundings inside the restaurant a large bake pan had high, thick biscuits cooling right next to the over, which I cannot get out of my mind as I write these words, because the biscuits smelled golden brown with butter, milk, flour, and yeast prepared to perfection. I wanted to return to order a dish off the menu using the biscuits, because the oven pan made them appear so delicious. The beach is a temptation. The small town is nearly hidden. I would have never stopped in Carpinteria unless my son ordered me to out of a desperation for hunger. Nor would I have found Linden Avenue, the location for Esau's Cafe. The walls are painted bright colors with surf boards and menus written out with colorful chalk. Nothing is saturated as you have in a fast food diner off the freeway with plastic wrapped egg sandwiches slapped with processed ham. Homemade dishes. Home cooked breakfast crafted by proud chefs. Even the cooks and staff walked around with confidence, because they were proud of the delicious dishes they were serving. The beach was relaxing. By the time we finished our first meal, the fog had burned off giving way to the sun. My son collected sea shells on the sand of the beach right next door to Esau's Cafe. My wife walked in the waves with her pants getting wet after taking off her socks and shoes. Our family returned to Carpinteria the very next week after driving seven hours from Las Vegas, Nevada, because the temptation of Esau's Cafe after waking up in Las Vegas was too great to resist the drive to find a resort hotel to sleep in so that we could dine at Esau's Cafe for another Sunday morning of searching for sea shells polished by the ocean waves next to the restaurant that continues to bring us back to Linden Avenue each time we need to engage in an exodus out of Nevada's dry climate. Dine at Esau's Cafe if you travel to Santa Barbara, Oxnard, Malibu, you have to eat at this Esau restaurant even if you have to take the Amtrak train. The Pacific Surfliner Amtrak train stops two minutes away by foot from Esau's Cafe. I tell you this because you can feel like your on a second honeymoon by stopping in to eat and stay the night in Carpinteria from San Diego to Santa Barbara. That is what I may do this weekend now that I remember by writing about the breakfast adventure.</td>\n",

Their food comes out fresh and quality is consistent with what I would expect at a Panera. I recommend the You Pick Two lunch option which offers meal for less than 600 calories (I recommend the Green Goddess Cobb salad with a cup of broccoli cheddar soup. Get the French baguette to soak up the left over soup in the bowl!) You can even just order a half salad without order you pick two if you want. I like ordering myself a bagel to go with the salad for a well rounded meal. Staff is also friendly and go around to collect trash when you're finished with your meal, which I don't really see at other Panera locations.

Finally decided to try something new and I've heard they were owned by the same folks who run Ulele's and The Columbia, so I knew they had to be very good. The outside is small and a little unassuming, but the food was anything but. They give you large portions and let you pick what you want. I'm not big into rice, so I chose the shredded chicken, side of plantains, and a side salad. My boyfriend, normally a very picky eater, went with the picadillo, black and yellow rice (surprised me since he's not normally big into rice either) and some plantains. For dessert he had flan. Both of us agree; you can really taste the love in the food. The chicken was moist and tender and simmering in a light sauce. There were peppers and carrots added in there which gave it a nice touch. The salad was pretty good for a side, and I loved how they also had shredded carrots added in, since most side salads are disappointing at best. Of course, the plantains made the meal for me. I loved the caramelized slight crunch savory sweetness that I expected and hoped for. It definitely went very well with the chicken and was more than enough carb for me. My boyfriend felt that the picadillo was the best hands down he's ever had, and he's had his fair share of picadillo. It was his first time ever having flan, and he didn't care for it, but like the flavor of it. For the amount of food you get, the price is more than reasonable. I especially love how its a stone's throw away from where I live.</td>\n",

Some of my favorite games are the connect four basketball shoot, Walking Dead (shooting zombies), Jurassic Park (shooting dinosaurs), and virtual bowling. So far today was the first time I also got food here. Its a great idea to have dinner or a light bite so you don't have to travel far for a good time. They have a relatively good selection on their menu that's pretty standard: sandwiches, flatbreads/pizza, salads, wings, tacos, quesadilla, and burgers. I loved how it was not all grilled food with no healthy options like I normally assume places like this would have. I actually went with salad which sounds basic and safe, but hear me out. The salad had a rather unique mix of dried cranberries almonds and brie cheese on top of spinach. The brie cheese was what sold me since I dont see this often in a casaul eatery.I had grilled chicken added to it for extra protein. The salad was fresh and delicious, though rather large but mainly on account of the spinach. At least I got a large amount of green in my diet. My boyfriend had a pepperoni flatbread which looked good and he enjoyed it. He also had a bottle of beer. They're not a full service liquor bar, but have a goid selection of beer. I did notice a few other things on their menu I'd like to try, but I definitely would have the salad as my default next time I come out here.</td>\n",

Besides that nifty outdoor tiki bar on the beach, the incredible view of the water, Whiskey Joe's has two other things that nobody else does (or at least is VERY hard to find). I'm talking about gator bites and beer cheese soup. Odd choice for a meal, but it's all I wanted. However Whiskey Joe's alone is an experience in and of itself. The decor is cool and offers a decent amount of seating where you could pass the one hourish wait time. I enjoyed admiring the fish tank and listening to some music while sitting in a nice plush chair. It was a busy Friday night when my boyfriend and I went, the sun was setting behind the horizon and people were rapidly come in and out in what seemed like droves from post pandemic restlessness. Bear in mind that Whiskey Joe's is valet parking ONLY, so either come prepared with cash or learn to pay via QR scanner. The forty minutes flew by quickly by the time they texted me for my table. Even though the pandemic is basically over, everyone was diligently wiping down the table tops. The menu was also QR scan, but I'm not as savvy with my smartphone as I should be, but they were more than willing to accommodate to me and give me a takeout menu to order from. I had to get my beer cheese soup and gator bites. It's been too long, and not many places have these items. The gator bites came out perfect: tender and juicy on the inside, generously breaded, crispy, yet not greasy on the outside. Came with fried pickles which was quite a treat for me because...I've never had fried pickles before. I loved how crisp and refreshing they were, going well with the spicy sauce it came with. The beer cheese soup was thick, and had this bite to it from the beer. Exactly as I remembered, and beer cheese soup is actually my favorite soup besides lobster bisque. We enjoyed our dinner against the perfect backdrop of the beach and the sunset. They have live music here sometimes, so this place will always be the spot to go for an overall good time.</td>\n",

I orginally wanted some mac n cheese with wings, but much to my dismay they stopped selling it. However, I settled for their cheesy bread as recommended by the server and the garlic parm wings. The cheesy bread was delicious and ate more like a mini pizza without sauce. The pita bread gave it a nice denseness that made it less heavy. The wings were juicy literally fall of the bone and had ample seasoning. I was even able to scoop up some of that seasoning with the cheese bread. I did have one drink Blue Balls that was vodka based which was smooth going down, but for me it was too bitter. Perhaps it was not the right drink for me as I normally really dont drink. I'll try something else next time. This is overall a fun place to be as they have alot of games to choose from as well as live music. Boyfriend had a great time here too and lived the wings (he has discerning taste in wings). Glad we found a great new spot for fun and eats!</td>\n",

My waiter was very kind and attentive, constantly checking if I needed anything. I was kinda in a hurry, so I was grateful when everything came out relatively quickly. The first thing I got was the sunomo salad (cucumber salad with daikon). It came with krab stick, shrimp, and octopus tentacle, which was quite a surprise because I didnt expect it, and I've never had this salad with octopus before. Nevertheless, it all tasted fresh and light, refreshing my palate in preparation for my two rolls. Again, it's been YEARS since I've had sushi so i wasnt quite sure what roles I wanted. I kept it plan and simple, opting for the Spider Roll and Mexican, perfect, never fail go-to's. These roles were HUGE, and for a moment i was nervous i wouldn't finish,  ut i made it through. They tasted great, without the sour, fishy, vinegary taste you would get with bad sushi, keeping their shape and form well from start to finish as they were expertly crafted. The sushi here is also comparatively cheap in comparison to other places on top of being of being large, so I definitely got my money's worth.</td>\n",

Sly's restaurant is one of the reasons you need to stay at least one night in Carpinteria while on vacation in California. I would return to Carpinteria just to share the experience of dining at Sly's with my family, especially after walking along the shore.</td>\n",

One thing I love about Italian food is the versatility and the large variety: so many combinations of food available. I haven't been to Brio's for quite a few years, so I thought I was overdue for a visit, and my last visit here wss great. I love pasta ala vodka, and they have their pasta with little satchels filled with ricotta and pancetta, so I went for that. My server asked about adding lobster meat, and loving lobster as much as I do, how can I resist,so I went ahead and went with his suggestion. The entire meal was delicious with the combination of the vodka sauce, ricotta, and lobster mixed in with the pancetta. Pasta was cooked to perfection as well so I was able to enjoy to fully enjoy all the different flavors and textures that come with the meal. Best of all the portion wasn't guargantuan,which sometimes can happen with Italian food, so it was enough that I could handle. It's nice being able to eat out at restaurants again, and I've always remembered how beautiful this restaurant is in the middle of the Baystreet Plaza at the International Mall area. Lovely sleek interior decor that gives an Old World Italian feel. I chose to enjoy the nice weather we had outside, and their patio was relatively comfortable and had enough shading from the outside elements. I do plan on coming back, more than likely for the same dish, but I would like to add the lobster bisque with it. Probably a dessert too while I'm at it. Customer service was great, especially considering the challenges faced in the height of the pandemic. I was seated right away even though the hostess was pretty busy handling phone calls, so that too was a plus.</td>\n",

I selected this place me and my boyfriend's pre Valentine's Day dinner (we celebrate on the weekend before V-day) since they had food items that both me and my boyfriend would be excited about (he's always a surf and turf kind of guy and drinks!). So glad about my choice. Nestled away in a plaza in Oldsmar, this was actually out of the way of the heavy traffic and the usual hot spot of restaurants everyone goes to. Nevertheless, the house was packed. Our waiter was very nice and laid back and took time to listen to our questions and requests. I started off with a mojito that was light and refreshing. I'm not normally a drinker, but I was really feeling it by the time I had finished it. Our apps came out shortly. I started off the with fire shrimp, Rob had the scallops and polenta. What I loved about their fire shrimp is that it was more like tempura style you would get at a sushi place and drizzled with a creamy sriracha sauce. The result was light crispy shrimp that had the spicy kick from the sriracha. I had the BLT wedge salad next. It was rather small with the right ratio of bacon, tomato, and blue cheese so I had a little bit at each bite. Finally, my special order mac and cheese arrived with my addition of truffle oil and crab meat. Wow, did they blow it out of the water! It was like my usual lobster mac and cheese, but with crab and truffle sauce. I can tell they mean business with this mac and cheese. It came out in a cast iron skillet, and was actually larger than I thought it would be (isn't this supposed to be an app??) One of the best mac and cheeses I've had in my life! I made a good call with the truffle oil and the flavor was well infused throughout the whole dish. They used a generous amount of actual lump crab meat which gave it a different spin on the usual seafood mac and cheese I get. It was finished off with panko crumbs and more cheese which gave it a lovely crust on top. I had to take one spoonful of it to eat there at the restaurant before bagging the rest at home as I was already full. However, I wanted to make sure I got some dessert, so I ordered their crème brulee to go. The result was a blobby mess in the Styrofoam container, but they still tried to dress it up pretty with whip cream on the side with a mint leaf and some berries. I had it much later when I was at home and it was light and creamy with a slight note of vanilla and caramelized sugar. This place is definitely an Oldsmar gem that is one of the best reasons to come out here!</td>\n",

It's not that many restaurants I know of that offer both healthy, yet tasty menu items alongside my favorite indulge comfort foods, but this place managed to accomplish both! Being a hard core lover of pizza and usually turning to wraps and sandwiches for healthy eating, I'm probably somewhat biased in my review. However, what's not to love? Their sandwiches are top notch. For one, they're more like sandwich imposters that is really pizza, as the bread they use for the sandwiches are more or less the pizza dough. (And in my case, that is a good thing and a compliment). I've had their portabella sandwich that was crafted expertly with fresh mozzarella and peppers all snug between two pieces of bread (or pizza crust, whatever). I really love how they pair their sandwiches with a simple, yet elegant arugula salad instead of the usual side of fries or chips which would undo the health benefits of the sandwich and pack on more calories. Being so won over by their healthy food, I decided to visit for their pizza and wings. I had their white pizza and paired this with their stuffed mushrooms. I can greatly appreciate how their personal pizza was more like a flat bread and not greasy so it wasn't overwhelming to eat. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious and had a generous dollop of goat cheese. On another visit I then had their pesto loco flat bread and had their garlic parmesan wings. The wings were large and had a lot of flavor to them. I had sauce to go with it, but I didn't use. The pesto loco flat bread I would liken to more like a white personal pizza. If you love pesto, this flatbread has a good ratio of pesto and mozzarella cheese the satisfy. You can enjoy your meal in a very beautiful, trendy interior that proudly displays Tampa's downtown.

The wait staff are friendly and are able to help guide me of what cheese to get depending on what kind of flavor am I going for. I recall this one hard cheese that had a strong truffle taste to it and then another cheese that spread like butter. All their crackers and breads make for a wonderful pairing to put the cheese on if its a spreadable kind. If I get a meat, I make myself mini sammiches with the breads, meats and cheese. They have spiced almonds, dried fruits, fruit strips, as well as honey, gherkins, and mustards to compliment your assortment. They offer small plates such as salads and small pasta dishes if you have a bigger appetite. The restaurant itself is a gorgeous sleek place to relax to eat whether you're having your meal there or filling up on meats and cheeses as late night snacking after drinking.</td>\n",

Personally, I've had quite a few dishes here that have come and gone with the seasons, but they are always good. What I can always rely on though is that their charcuterie board is UNMATCHABLE in quality. I've had charcuterie in quite a few a places and theirs is the best. They have a wide ranges of cheeses and the menu describes from what animal and describes the texture. Meat selection is pretty vast too, but I find myself often going with just cheeses. It's all beautifully cut up and displayed on a wooden board and they have a wide variety of accompaniments such as spiced almonds, local honey, artisan jams, crackers, olives, gherkin, and bread slices.I like to pick 3 cheese/meats and pair that up with another dish (being that I have the appetite). I try to save an appetite for their pasta dish, because they have some of the THE freshest tasting pasta I've ever had and have a unique flavor. This they've opened, this has been one of my favorite places in St. Pete.</td>\n",

In addition to these always tender pancakes having the perfect balance of pumpkin spice and flavor is the deliciously rich caramel pecan sauce that comes with it (i always ask for extra because i like my pancakes drowning in sauce or syrup). Sometimes it cones with whipped cream, sometimes it doesn't, either way is fine, I guess it depends on who's cooking.

I frequent DTSP, so finding a good pizza place was always on my mind, but none them ever piqued my interest since they were generic fast food pizza joints. What set this place apart from the rest was the extensive variety of pizzas they do in non-conventional combinations (carbonara pizza?? roast beef with blue cheese???!! Okay, now they got my attention!) Most importantly, they have white pizza, which I haven't seen in any of the other pizzerias' menus. Although the variety drew me in there, it was also somewhat overwhelming. What to choose?? I went ahead and got their white pizza, since its my favorite. The thing about white pizza also is that nobody makes it the same. I enjoyed their rendition of it. Normally the white pizzas I've seen don't have meat, just spinach and sometimes tomato and mushroom. Theirs had Italian sausage, but I didn't mind that so I had it as is. I had the pleasure of eating it hot off the oven. The crust was thick, crisp on the outside, but chewy and tender on the inside. It was rather heavy laden with the ricotta, goat cheese, and sauce, but held together well as I tore the slices from the pie. I loved how the sharpness of the goat cheese balanced out the mild creaminess of the ricotta. It had a generous portion of vegetables so I felt less guilty for not getting salad today. They were fresh and added bright color: spinach, onions, and peppers, which went well with the Italian sausage. I ordered a personal pizza, which had four slices and was deceptively small as it took me an hour to eat the whole thing!. Luckily I came hungry so I didn't leave overfull. The personal pizza special came with chips and a drink which for $10 was a great deal, but you need to come before 4pm. They're next to Cupcakes Spot, so I highly recommend getting a cupcake to go AFTER having the pizza! Definitely planning another visit here, just not sure of what to get next!</td>\n",

I've so far had the pleasure of having their crab meat (which by the way as real crab, and bits of shell, which can happen with crabmeat) and the beef and cheese (probably my favorite). Surprisingly, even though an empanada should have a generous amount of filing, my favorite part of them is actually the shell. I love how crispy it is on the outside, but soft and flaky on the inside. They're a relatively decent size; they look small but one will fill you up if you're trying to watch your portion. I did enjoy the salad as well even though it is basically just lettuce and olives. What makes it for me is the dressing with parmesan cheese, so if you're a cheese fan you'll enjoy this. Their café con leche is very good too; rich, creamy, and good body so I feel satisfied at the end of my meal. The store if very small, very clean. There's only two workers there, but its never crowded and you get your food quickly. Good spot to go to for a no fuss meal! I live in the area so I enjoy walking over there.

It is exactly how it is prepared in Thailand without using ketchup which would give it a red coloring which you will find with many westernized versions of the dish.  The Northern Thai Curry is another dish that they do really well and is probably my favorite.  I like to come to this restaurant for the food but also for the atmosphere.  It is always packed and sitting around the kitchen at the counter gives you a great vantage point to see the chefs at work.  The only downside is that it is always packed with people.  I recently learned that if the counter is full you can just get takeout and sit at one of the communal seats in the marketplace.  It isn't as fun as the counter but it could be a bit faster.</td>\n",

Rabbit liked the James Beard award and I was all taken a bit with the novelty of Mediterranean fare having been thinking only of Creole for about the last three months straight.\\n\\nI did mental tricks to remember to bookmark after deplaning as the WiFi was broken and I'd have considered paying the 8 clams just for this but it was broken so I had to make a little Shaya song in my head.  It seemed significant.\\n\\nOn Saturday after Commander's Palace the evening before and the other almost obligatory stops hither and yon it was raining and off we went on the St. Charles streetcar through and past the Garden District to a part of the fine city where I had not yet been.  For a moment that morning I was all it's raining and maybe some more Creole local goodness maybe at K-Paul's right down the street or maybe drinks all day at the Carousel Bar but no there was a bookmark and duty called.  The streetcar is a must-ride anyway and it wasn't raining that hard and the hotel gave us an umbrella and I was pretty much out of excuses at that point.\\n\\nSo let me tell you.  This is the only review I'm going to write for this last trip to New Orleans.  Because Shaya pretty much put everything else on the everything else list.  Its location on Magazine out by Napolean forces the visitor from the Quarter discomfort zone in such a way that also makes convenient a lovely streetcar ride then a lovely stroll back to the madness with perambulation through Garden and right past the cemetery that if the timing is right you can poke into and play Rainy Day Woman in your head.\\n\\nMake a reservation unless you're all about rolling dice and sadness at the outcome.  I'm thinking that we were blessed by the rain, for as we had no spot reserved thinking it's the middle of a Saturday afternoon who needs to be all hemmed in by promises.  You need to be, trust, as but for the inclemency we might not have even snagged those two seats at the bar after a little wait because it was full.  Not a reservation to be had and the tables turned with maybe a little breather so staff could make them perfect and welcoming for the next lucky contestants.\\n\\nFeast.\\n\\nThere are little accompaniment plates of pickled and roasted things and small salads three for 15 and I think 5 for 25 (por nous Brussels sprouts and pickled things and a little tabbouleh), different ways for hummus (butternut squash), lamb kabobs without sticks that were so good on a rainy day and a shakshoukah in a pan which is also for the rain and I am as serious as I am sitting here right now - everything was so perfect.  The bar seating is sometimes a preference for me if the chairs have backs for you know who and they did.  In the right place such an arrangement allows for more frequent interaction with a person that knows stuff if there is one and Saturday the fellow that helped us with our happiness knew so much.\\n\\nA couple of miles strolling through sidewalks that in California would be lawsuits and gas lamps all over then a quick cemetery and back in the Quarter we were exercised and ready for round whatever of whatever it wasn't going to be Shaya.\\n\\nIf you live in New Orleans you have the luxury of time, so go maybe on a special night.  If you're planning a visit, plan ahead.  Make bookmarks and reserve early.  Trust.  You need to go here.</td>\n",

Getting apps are a great way of getting a sample of some food without the major commitment, but not leaving something to be desired. I've had my fair share of seafood mac and cheese and each place makes it differently. What gives this dish its unique flavor hefty amount of crab meat on top of it and the lager beer sauce, which I could really taste. I love crab cakes, but I really loved this lump lobster cake that came with a thick spicy sauce. Their alligator hush puppies were wonderfully moist and flavorful on the inside and crisp on the outside. The guava pie was a perfect finale for the evening. It was very light and not at all too sweet with a shortbread crust.

I have never been here before, but it has been on my bucket list for the longest time since its first opened for many reasons. Looking over the menu, it has alot of southern faves (fried chicken) with a chic twist (those bowls that have lately been all the rage) so i knew it would have alot to offer any taste. Sooo....today was a cheat day...meaning no bars hold on what I could get to indulge in...but despite of that, i couldn't take my eyes away from their #1 salad with ahi tuna. First off, on my cheat day, i dont do salads, second, unless its Panera, i really dont do salads...period. However, i REALLY love ahi, and the description sounded so fresh and tantalizing, that i just couldnt resist the urge to try it. So i went for it. I had the grilled artichokes as my app, because again, it's not sonething i see often on a menu. Of course, i eas eyeballing the keylime pie before i even got my app ordered. The artichokes were delicious with a nice crisp to them. I really enjoyed digging into the hearts and dipping it into the sauce. When my salad, i was pleased for two reasons, 1) it wasnt a voluminous mass of lettuce with some toppings sprinkled on as dinner salads tend to be and 2) it was nicely plated, a small mound of the salad that had avocado, carrot, and lightly dressed with mango. Of course, i dove into the ahi first. Fresh and delicate in taste, i will never go back to canned. The salad itself had a nice light flavor to it, which was refreshing too from the mango. I took my keylime pie home to go and ravished it immediately upon arriving. It had this nice tart creamy flavor which was balanced by the whipped cream. I normally dont finish the crust, but their crust was airy in texture and went great with the rest of the whipped cream.</td>\n",

Word of advice for anyone who arrives past 5 pm on a Saturday night; make sure you have a reservation. The place was packed with people waiting for a table and we were seated rather quickly at a nice, clean booth. Our waitress attended to us right away to get our drinks. I knew what I wanted right away; crispy buffalo shrimp and for my entrée, the lobster mac n cheese. The only thing was I was very torn between getting the appetizer mac and cheese and getting the full entrée. My friend convinced me to get the entrée, so I got that. Our apps came out first: she had the crab cakes (her favorite), and of course there was my buffalo shrimp. I had to try some of hers: all lump crab meat atop some corn and tomato. The seasoning they put in it gave the crab cake a lovely kick. I think my buffalo shrimp was better though; it had the right breading to meat ratio, crispy on the inside and kept its form on the shrimp as I slathered it with the chunky bleu cheese. Each shrimp was also lovingly coated with their not too spicy buffalo sauce. The shrimp sat on a bed of shredded lettuce, which I used as a small salad with the remainder of the buffalo sauce and the bleu cheese (and there was a generous amount left). Then my entrée came: seeing the size of it, I instantly wished I got the appetizer portion instead. However, I was determined to eat only half and bring the rest home to my boyfriend (who luckily agreed to eat some when I brought it back) and me to share. It came with asparagus on the side. I eat quite a bit of lobster mac and cheese, and I feel that I've had it from many places enough to say with authority that no two lobster mac n cheese dishes are the same. This one happens to be rated per them to be \"the best lobster mac n cheese\" in the Tampa Bay area. I do feel that the title is well deserved. This special dish consists of spiral pasta covered with cheddar cheese sauce, some scallions for accenting flavor, bread crumbs on top (not usually a fan of bread crumbs though for mac n cheese) and notably large clumps of lobster meat. I enjoyed every last bit of my half of the dish. My friend had salmon, and although hers was a bit too dry for my taste, she stated that this salmon was some of the best she's had. Our meals were also somewhat modestly priced for what we got. My buffalo shrimp with lobster mac and cheese was only some thirty dirty dollars. My boyfriend was happy with the mac n cheese too that I brought home and we shared. This is definitely one of my top picks for seafood in the area.</td>\n",

I was so impressed with what I sampled at a previous Elite Event, that I knew my boyfriend and friends would be too. I started off with their strawberry basil tea, which was a perfect balance of earthy and sweet. For my dinner I had their pasta carbonara with penne pasta instead of spaghetti (per the waiters suggestion) and Voodoo Shrimp and Thai Chili Shrimp for appetizer (no pic of the Thai shrimp--boyfriend got greedy and at it all as soon as it was brought out). The entire dinner was outstanding. The sauce on the voodoo shrimp was so thick and flavorful that everyone was sopping it up with the warm breadsticks brought out. I'm huge on pasta dishes, and I think their pasta carbonara is the best I've tasted before. It wasn't too heavy as this dish could be, and had a rather generous portion of bacon and chicken on it. Even though the sauce lightly coated the dish, it still had a bold rich flavor. As great as all the food was, I think the crowning glory of the whole meal was the best dessert I've ever had (which is a huge superlative because I LOVE ALL kinds of desserts and have had a lot). Their chocolate decadence cake, which I first got acquainted with at the yelp event, is so rich yet had a mousse like texture. I really loved their coffee whipped cream that accompanied it. I would go to Grillsmith JUST for that dessert. I would definitely get the exact same dinner on my next visit, except maybe keep spaghetti for the pasta.</td>\n",

From the fresh crisp salads with a large variety of toppings, down to the dough they use for the pizza and croutons, Marco's gets it right. I usually go with one of two items: A personal Cheezy White pizza or their meatball bake with a side of cheezy bread and garden salad (that I split with my boyfriend). No other pizza place has the unique Cheezy White that Marco's has. Where do I begin what I love about it?? Well, for one, no red sauce, but it has fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and bacon. The flavor combo is incredible. The meatball bake with cheezy bread as the side is basically a deconstructed meatball pizza, but I'm okay with that.  I like to use the red sauce (I normally hate red sauce, but I love theirs because of the bold robust flavor, not watered down or sweet like some other sauces) to tip the thick buttery cheezy bread. Their salads are decent too if you want to try to be a little healthy. Their garden salad has a generous amount of black olives, green peppers, tomatoes, and onions, with cheddar cheese to complete it. My favorite stay-at-home and watch TV kinda meal.</td>\n",

And for us, that part of our life is all about the greatness that is Freebirds ... and hell, who are we kidding, it's still all about Freebirds.  Because whether it's a high school don't-tell-the-parents-we're-going-to-UCSB run, a college heading-down-to-see-buddies run, or an I'm-driving-on-the-101-anywhere-near-Santa-Barbara run ... it's important to plan your adventure around Freebirds.  In a nutshell, it's a 24 hour Mexican joint serving up giant burritos, piled high nachos, and our personal favorite, stuffed-with-more-junk-than-a-junior-high-training-bra quesadillas.  As we eluded to it above, The Good Grub discovered this place back in the good ol' days of high school, driving up to Isla Vista for a little ... um ... higher education?  Well let's just say Freebirds' taught us more about life than any US History or Geometry teacher ever could ... and drunk food is delicious!  But without hesitation, this stuff is AMAZING ... any time of day, any hunger level, any blood alcohol level.  Ever been waiting in line, waiting to order, and realize that if you don't swallow soon, your mouth watering-with-anticipation will surely drown you before too long?  What? ... Never happened to you? ... Well, you've clearly never waited in line at Freebirds, eying down the massive assembly-line style of Mexican glory.  Pick your vessel (burrito, nachos, or, as we mentioned, our pick ... the quesadilla), then load it up with as much beans (black, pinto, or sticky-icky re-fried), rice, cheese, fresh salsas, lettuce, sour cream, onions (raw or deep-fried), cilantro, and a healthy thwap of guacamole ... if you know what you're doing.  And if you really want to look like a local, go for one of their hybrids.  Like a \"quesarito\"... basically a quesadilla with all it's melty cheesiness ... then opened up, filled up, and rolled into burrito glory.  Because why would you want to eat a burrito that doesn't have a metly layer of cheese in every bite?  And now you've got a little idea why I bounce with excitement when I get a chance to go back to this place ... and if you don't yet ... you will soon.  Because the Grub is coming, and Freebirds is bringing it strong!</td>\n",

I've also had their Pasta Brava, which is their version of pasta carbonara, and this is good too. I get a side of the misticanza  salad (simple garden salad) and added gorgonzola cheese for an extra dollar. My sister swears by their brussel sprouts and this is the only thing she gets here.

Of course, I'm talking about delicious, tasty grilled cheese. Grilled cheese is one of those essential comfort foods that everyone loves (mostly) and Central Melt offers up a rather large variation of the classic. The menu includes sandwiches with different types of cheeses, meats, and veggies as well as sauces. The first time I ever tried Central Melt was when they had their special Blueberry Basil melt. Not something I would try on my own since I typically don't like fruits in savory dishes (even though I'm coming around a little), but curiosity got the best of me. The sandwich incredible, but it was only offered that one time. I went ahead and tried a regular grilled cheese, since I never feel like you can go wrong with the classics. This, of course, is not your elementary school's grilled cheese. Everything about the sandwich was perfect: the crisp on the outside chewy on the inside thick cut of white bread, the melted generous portion of cheddar cheese that was present in every bite that even oozed outside the crust. I added some tomato for more texture and flavor. I'm not normally a fry kind of girl, but I do love their nacho cheese fries to go along with the sandwich. These fries were perfectly seasoned, crisp and smothered with white cheese on top of nacho cheese sauce so I could taste it with each bite. The people here are friendly too, which is always an added plus. Apparently they also make tomato soup and salad, which I haven't tried yet, but I might get around it if I don't get too full from what will be my usual when I come here.</td>\n",

I felt that this place nailed everything from presentation of food to customer service, so the reputation I've read about is very well deserved. We came here for dinner on the Saturday before Valentine's Day. For my appetizer I ordered the Fried Tomato salad. I love how lightly coated with breading the tomato was, almost like a tempura so it had a nice crunch as I bite into it. I ate the two tomatoes like tacos with the goat cheese on top. It came with a bright fresh mix of arugula salad for a nice light finish. Since I don't normally drink, the Fig Lebowski was a bit too strong for me, but I loved the sweet brown sugary taste of it. Then we ordered our main dish. Because I'm a fan of duck, I had to have the duck as my main. This particular dish is a cut above the other duck entrees I've had before. For one thing, it was very lean and yet it practically melted in my mouth as a chewed it. I put the yogurt sauce on top of it which enhanced the flavor. This dish came with more of the arugula and lentils. I'm definitely not a fan of rice, so I appreciated how they had the lentils as the grain to go with the meal. The portions are relatively small, but enough to fill up on, which was another plus for me (I hate when I get so full and overwhelmed with large quantities of food). The staff here was awesome and friendly to chat with. Even Chef Pierola herself stopped to chat with us and asked how everything was. Somehow we ended up with our desserts free. I was kind of full already so I just ordered the ice cream; one of the dishes they well known for. I had two scoops of the chicory coffee ice cream (I really love coffee, so this was a natural choice) and the brown butter flavor (out of curiosity and I've heard great things about this flavor). I thought I made a perfect choice with the pairing. The chicory coffee had a good bold taste of coffee , but then the subtle sweetness from the brown butter scoop balanced it out. The three scoops came out in a bed of brown sugar, which was a nice touch. Their menu changes frequently, but when I come back, I would love to get the same thing! Definitely worth an encore presentation!</td>\n",

Grimaldi's makes thin crust New York style pizzas. Apparently they use New York water in order to create authentic tasting New York pizza dough. The results are delicious. I get a nice thin crust that's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I'm a sucker for white pizza, so I either choose their Quattro Formaggio or the Classic White with garlic. Both are different in that the latter is your usual white pizza while for the former as more bite to it from the gorgonzola cheese. My pizza that I got today was the Quattro Formaggio with ricotta cheese (an extra $2). The four cheeses melted together perfectly creating this creamy texture from the ricotta and the sharp flavor from the gorgonzola. I had the personal pizza with every intent to eat it all, but my twin, who is a picky eater, had two slices. Of course, my visit is never complete without their cheesecakes! They are some of the freshest, creamiest cheesecakes around and come in a variety of flavors depending on the season. Every January so far, they've carried my favorite of all time, their amaretto cheesecake made with amaretto cookie crust, amaretto New York cheesecake, toasted almonds and whipped cream. Creamy, not too sweet, with some fluffy texture as the fork rakes through the cake. I love the slightly browned top of the cheesecake filling. If I'm not in the mood for pizza, I'll always make sure I make a trip for these cheesecakes!</td>\n",

All the wait staff was very friendly and helpful. My boyfriend and I each had a filet mignon, Oscar style with some variation. My boyfriend stated that his dinner was the best filet mignon he's ever had. My dish was equally as wonderfull; tender meat topped by large amount of fresh crab meat and four grilled asparagus spears. I also had a lobster bisque soup. It had the perfect consistency, not too runny, and not too thick. There were bits of lobster meat in the soup and was flavored with a dash of different spices that gave it complex flavor. Of course, because I'm a dessert diva, I had to have my dessert. But first, they surprised me by sprinkling confetti on our table before I ordered my dessert. I had the chocolate espresso torte, which thankfully was very small because this taste little torte was dense and thick. It mixed two of my favorite flavors: chocolate and coffee! I followed up this filling dessert with the refreshing raspberry sorbet with the fresh berries and crème anglaise. The best surprise for me is that my dessert came with a candle and the words \"Happy Birthday\" were written in chocolate! I had forgotten my camera that day (I don't like using my phones to take that many pictures other than my food) so the waitress took our photo with my dessert before I finally ate it. I even got a card that the staff signed. Very sweet gesture, and wonderful food. Price is high, but to me the food I worth it! Best for going on a special occasion.

Well, I was wrong. The first time I came out here was for New Year's Eve. My boyfriend and I first took notice of the wonderful smell of grilled meat and the cleanliness of the inside of the restaurant. I had the seafood fra diavlo alfredo style. This seafood alfredo was wonderfully seasoned seasoned: al dente fettucine pasta lightly coated with alfredo sauce, but it has a nice kick to it! The pasta even came with large portion of shrimp, scallops, and lobster tail. Serving was very generous of all the seafood, and each element of it were seasoned perfectly. I was so impressed, I came back to try to the sushi. All of it is always fresh and they have a large variety of sushi rolls to choose from. I typically go for the Screaming Delight (cooked) because I love spicy mayo and avocado. Service is always on point and attentive.

Italian happens to be my favorite type of food, and good ol' faithful  Carrabba's is always there to deliver. Where do I start? First off, the food they serve taste fresh and flavorful. Two meal combinations I enjoy is their Mezzaluna pasta and their new small plate dish stuffed mushroom. I also enjoy their traditional lasagna with the small plate meatballs and ricotta (and I normally don't go for traditional lasagna with most chain restaurants, but theirs is so good, I make an exception). The Mezzaluna is their ravioli dish with chicken, ricotta, and spinach covered in a mild tomato sauce. The ingredients seem somewhat understated, but the taste is incredible. I enjoy the taste and texture of the ricotta and sauce. They are also very generous with cheese. I notice that the stuffed mushrooms are in the same sauce and so I smother them in it as I eat it. The second dish pairing I order is the small plate meatballs and ricotta and traditional lasagna. I get a generous size of well seasoned ground meat in a bath of Pomodoro sauce and ricotta. I get enough smooth, rich ricotta to balance out the sauce in this dish. It may seem generic, but their traditional lasagna is not to be missed. Lasagna is by far my favorite food, but it tends to be hard to find a good traditional lasagna in most Italian restaurants. What I love most about theirs is the abundant amount of cheese in the dish and that its not swimming in Pomodoro sauce. The sauce is simply draped on top. Add a large amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese, and I'm in business. Staff is very friendly and welcoming, so its always nice for me to come here. If you've saved enough room, the desserts are pretty good. So far I've had the mini cannoli and the cheesecake.</td>\n",

I went with their signature salad since it's my fave added with a hard boiled egg and seared Ahi tuna (my favorite way to have it). What I love about this salad is how well the ingredients work together like the goat cheese, avocado, sunflower seeds, and raisins (which I normally hate, but for the salad, it works because it adds a depth of sweetness to it). I washed it all down with their infused water which has mint and strawberries it. Very refreshing on a scorching hot day. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming in my approach. The food was every bit as delicious as I would expect at any SoFresh, and it's safe to say that Carrollwood is in for a treat!</td>\n",

              "      <td>So far, I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant for many reasons. One is the huge variety on the menu. It ranges from indulgent go-to comfort foods (which for me is of course any pasta and shrimp n grits--which I saw) to lighter fare (I had my eye on the soft shell crab BLT salad). Alas, I came here right after indulging at Chocolate Pi, so I had to narrow down my choice for dinner, which I was very happy with. I went Italian tonight and had their mussels for appetizer and semi healthy with mushroom pasta. What a enjoyed about the mussels is their presentation and seasoning on it. Mussels are one of those appetizers done in many different ways (fra diavlo, white wine and garlic) and I did enjoy their rendition of it. I came in a light broth with tomatoes, spicy sausage, onions, so it had a rather spicy kick that I could actually taste in the mussels themselves. Before guzzling the rest of the sauce with a spoon, I soaked up what I could with the two pieces of bread that it came with. The mushroom pasta I thought was a good choice following the mussels. It looked deceptively light, however, it was somewhat rich. The fettuccine noodles were cooked well and were generously coated with the pesto sauce and topped off with a good heap of mushrooms. I went solo so I did get the single portion of the dish, which was still rather large, so it might be a good idea to split the single portion if you do decide to take a friend with you (unless both of you REALLY love pasta and want the same dish). The service here is also very good: hostess seated me right away and my waiter checked on me rather often. I'm eager to come back, this time with company.  Good place to go for a laid back evening or dinner with friends. I noted that they do have dessert here, so I'll make sure to get some!</td>\n",

Haven't been here for a while myself, but was happy to come back. My boyfriend got the filet mignon with lobster tail, grilled vegetable skewers with baked apples, and two bottles of beer. I was more conservative with my meal and got the hearty and healthy version of the six ounce filet mignon with steamed broccoli and side salad. I got the peppercorn parmesan dressing on the side, so I indulged a little. My meal was delicious and satisfying; the filet was well seasoned and tender. I liked how the side salad was a good size with a variety of vegetables. The dressing was delicious and coated my salad well, so I got to enjoy it thoroughly without really feeling like I was eating healthy. My boyfriend loved his meal too; surf and turf is his favorite. He mentioned that both lobster and filet mignon were flavorful and grilled to perfection. The veggie skewer were juicy, yet crisp and well charred. The baked apples had the right balance of sweetness and zest to finish off the meal. The beers were so chilled they almost turned to slush as he poured it into the ice cold frosted glass mug. Our waiter Chase was very friendly and helpful when we were making our selections and was attentive throughout our stay. We love how clean the interior is with casual feel. For two filet mignon dinners, I only paid just over fifty bucks, which is not bad at all. Good place to go if you want high end quality food, but not a stuffy atmosphere.</td>\n",

This benedict used crab cake instead of English muffin, which I thought was creative. The crab cake was chunky with crab meat and seasoned well. Each were topped off with fried egg over easy, and smothered with hollandaise sauce. I rounded off my meal with their creamy cheesy grits. Both meals made me remember why I loved this place.

Well, I decided to wake up extra early to give this place a try. It's a basic breakfast/lunch spot with more than affordable prices. Upon entering the place I did notice that everything looked clean and new. The staff was very nice and seated me right away. My waitress was very sweet and and attentive, checking on me often. They specialize in omelets, so despite the extensive breakfast menu, I decided to go with that. The variety was huge and endless it seemed in what kind of omelet to get, but lately my taste has simplified so I went for the Wisconsin Omelet, which is a safe choice and always a crowd pleaser. The omelets all come with a choice of hash browns, home fries, etc., and unless you have the appetite of a lumberjack, I recommend tomato slices or fresh fruit. It also comes with choice of bread, and being that I already ordered lean, I went with the biscuits and gravy. All my food came out rather quickly, but it was all hot and fresh! The biscuits were soft and rich, and came with much more than enough gravy. I cut my my omelet and ate that with the tomato slices. At first glance, the omelet didn't look like much, but once you start cutting into it, its a monster packed with cheese, definitely living up to its name. It had cream cheese in it, which was a nice touch, as I've never seen that before. It gave it a creamy taste that made it pretty unique to most omelets I've had. Definitely worth the early wake up.</td>\n",

I also realized that I love gastropubs; they're definitely high end enough to serve quality food and drinks but without the stuffiness and formality. For my meal I got their baked ziti and the calamari appetizer. My boyfriend got the hangar steak and fries with wings as a starter. He also got three, don't know what they were, but he enjoyed them. He finished off his meal with a vanilla bourbon bread pudding. My ziti was delicious; lightly coated in the marinara with a huge dollop of ricotta cheese in the middle so when I got it I stirred it up so the ricotta was spread evenly. For a normally heavy dish, it was rather light to me and I was able to finish it. It had a good ratio of meat to pasta to ricotta to sauce so there was no overpowering element to it. Calamari was delicious, light, and looked more like a tempura then fried (I know its the same thing, but lighter) and had the right amount of crisp and chewiness. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and was able to answer questions about the items on the menu. Would definitely go back as I did notice a few other items that looked equally appealing.</td>\n",

Today I was in the mood for something simple, so I got their baked ziti dinner that comes with a side salad and garlic knots. The side salad was much to get excited  over, but I do give major props on the crispy garlicky crotons on top that gave it a delicious crunch. I later on worked on my garlic knots that were nice and soft and came with plenty of garlic butter and crusted with garlic. Then came the ziti. I haven't ziti in years which had always been and old favorite if mine, and with one bite I remembered why it was. It had an ample mix of ricotta and mozzarella that I was able to taste with each bite. It was quite large, but I did manage to finish it.
